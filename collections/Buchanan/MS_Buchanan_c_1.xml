                        <p>Most of the quires which contain an illuminated initial—and only these quires—have the cropped remains of a series of leaf signatures consisting of a letter and number (notionally from a1-a6 in quire I, to h1-h6 in quire XVII): quire II has 'b5' extant (fol. 15r), quire V has 'c1', 'c2', and part of 'c3' (fols. 41r-43r), quire IX has 'e2'-'e6' extant (fols. 82r-86r), quire XII has parts of 'f2'-'f6' (fols. 112r-116r), quire XV has 'g1'-'g5' (fols. 139r-143r), and quire XVII has parts of 'h1'-'h5' (fols. 159r-163r). These leaf signatures were presumably provided to facilitate the re-assembly of the bifolia of each of these quires in the correct order, after they had been dis-assembled so that the illuminator could work on them. Each quire has a catchword except when the following quire contains an illuminated initial: presumably the binder assembled the quires according to catchwords, and on encountering a quire without a catchword, he followed it by a quire with leaf signatures, in alphabetical order. The purpose of the quire numbers at the end of quires VI, XI, and XV, is unclear; and the reason why they are each one ahead of the true quire number is obscure unless a prefactory quire is now lost; the numbers may possibly have been part of a tally of the amount of parchment used.</p>
                        <p>The collation shows that the makers of the book wanted to keep open the possibility that the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> would be bound in two volumes, perhaps without the <hi rend="italic">Commentarius</hi>, since the <hi rend="italic">Commentarius</hi> starts on a new quire, and in the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> the end of Book VII falls at the end of a short quire. Several copies of the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> are divided into two volumes at this point; see <bibl>Emilio Santini, 'Leonardo Bruni aretino e i suoi Historiarum florentini populi libri XII', <title>Annali della R. Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa</title> 22, Filosofia e Filologia (1910), (separately paginated:) 1–173, 125–9, nos. II, III, VIII, XI, XVIII, XIX.</bibl>
