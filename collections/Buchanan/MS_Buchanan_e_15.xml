                     <note>
                        <p>(no modern edition found; pr. in numerous early editions, under the name of Lucius Fenestella, for which see <title>Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke VIII</title> (Stuttgart, Berlin, New York, 1978), cols. 496–500); fols. 43r-44v ruled, otherwise blank.</p>
                        <p>Andrea di Domenico Fiocchio (or Floccus) (d. 1452) wrote a tract in two books titled <title>De potestatibus Romanorum</title> (or <title>Romanis</title>), probably in the 1420s (see apostolico: alcune notizie e varie lettere di Andrea Fiocchi, canonico fiorentino', in <title>Ultimi contributi alla storia degli umanisti, fascicolo I: Traversariana</title> (Studi e testi, 90: Vatican City, 1939), 97–131, at 97–101, 130–1). Incipits are [preface:] 'Cum per hos dies ...' (Bertalot, <title>Initia humanistica</title>, II/I, no. 3757), [tract:] 'Omnium deorum quas vetus Romanorum superstitio ...'. This work circulated under his name (e.g. Bodleian, MS. d'Orville 50, fols. 1–31v), and anonymously (e.g. <title>Sotheby &amp; Co., Important western and oriental miniatures ... 11 December, 1961</title> (London), lot 170 and pl. 15, dated 5 Nov. 1465).</p>
                        <p>Perhaps in Fiocchio's lifetime, however, and at least as early as 1469 (see R. Sabbadini, <title>Le scoperte dei codici latini e greci ne' secoli XIV e XV: nuove ricerche col riassunto filologico dei due volumi</title> (Biblioteca storica del rinascimento, 5: Florence, 1914), 222), an abridged one-book version without the preface appeared, attributed to the Augustan historian, Fenestella, who had indeed written a work about Roman magistrates. The 'Fenestella' version is titled <title>De Romanorum magistratibus</title>, and opens: 'Omnium deorum quos uetus Romanorum religio excoluit ...'. It is the 'Fenestella' which was first printed (Venice, 1474) (see John Monfasani, 'Calfurnio's identification of pseudepigrapha of Ognibene, Fenestella, and Trebizond, and his attack on renaissance commentaries', <title>Renaissance quarterly</title> 41 no. 1 (1988), 32–43, esp. 36).</p>
                        <p>The present manuscript is a copy (with errors) of the Ps.-Fenestella redaction. The attribution in the rubric to 'Plinius' must refer to Pliny the Elder, who referred to the real Fenestella in his <title>Natural History</title>.</p>

MS. Buchanan c. 1), their nail-holes skilfully repaired; the edges of the leaves gauffered and gilt; rebacked by 1898, with new parchment pastedowns and conjoint flyleaves, probably by <orgName key="org_263208235" role="bnd">Messrs.

Buchanan c. 1): 'PLINIVS | DE | MAGIST-|RATIBVS | ROMAN-|ORVM || MS. | IN | MEMBRANIS', and with a saltire pattern in blind in each compartment. Matching pairs of nail(?)-holes in the bevelled fore-edges of of both the upper and lower boards, near the top, bottom (and perhaps middle?), possibly indicate that thin ties were once used to secure the volume closed.</p>

CCLXXIV; but closer to the design in Marco Vicenzo Coronelli, ed., <title>Arme, blasoni, ò insegne gentilitie delle famiglie patritie esistenti nelle serenissime republica di Venetie</title> ([Venice?, 1694?]; the arms also appear in a slightly earlier manuscript, sold at Sotheby's, London, 11 Dec. 1961, lot 169, ill. in pl. 14). The initials, presumably of the scribe, occur in pink roman square capitals at the end of the text (fol. 42v): '<persName key="person_8" role="scr">.P.E.F.A.</persName>'. The same scribe copied San Marino, Huntington Library, HM 1031 (see Dutschke, <title>Huntington cat.</title>, I, 293–4), and Vienna, ÖNB, Cod. 3180 (see Hermann, <title>Verzeichnis der illuminierten Handschriften in Österreich</title>, n.F., VI/2, 19–20, Taf. VII.2), both of which also have the coat of arms of the Erizzo family, and both of which contain the initials 'P.E.A.F.'; de Ricci <title>Census</title>, I, 81 (followed by Dutschke) proposed that the initials may stand for 'Paulus Erizzo Antonii Filius' (fl. 1473–1503?). Dutschke transcribes the following inscription in the Huntington manuscript: '1658 24 Decembre. Questo manoscrito fu comparato da me Marsilio Papafava con molti altri da Messer Paolo Fasolati per ducenti venti.'; it is possible the Buchanan manuscript was also among the those sold by Fasolati to Papafava.</provenance>
                  <provenance> Unidentified Italian library, 18th(?) century: fol. iii is a small sheet of laid paper, pasted to the recto of fol. ii, inscribed on the present recto: 'Falsò in hoc Codice Plinio | inscribitur Opus de Magistratibus | Romanorum | Cum sit Lucij Fenestellæ, ut ex impressis | apparet | Codex iste nitidissimus Saec: XV ad | illustrem familiam Erizzo de | Venetijs pertinuit ut | ex Stemmate in fronte Codicis | adposito apparet.'; the configuration of worm-holes in this leaf and in the following parchment leaves indicate that it was previously inserted slightly higher up, with its present recto as the verso; and traces of glue(?) along the present gutter edge of the present verso suggest that it was originally pasted along this edge to the board, or to a previous pastedown.</provenance>
                  <provenance> Messrs. J. &amp; J.

('in the original Venetian binding, nice specimen'); Messrs. Leighton and other, unidentified, 19th-century bookseller(s)? are presumably responsible for various pencil inscriptions: in the top left corner of the upper pastedown is '2239', and in the bottom gutter corner 'il/t/-'(?) above '6/SS' (?); and in the top right corner of fol. ir: 'xc'(?). </provenance>
