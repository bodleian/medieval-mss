                  <provenance> Written in Florence and dated 1455 by the scribe 'DE VARIETATE FORTVNE LIBER | QVARTVS EXPLICIT :- :- 1455.' (fol. 122r); the script is attributable to the Florentine notary ser Giovanni di Piero da Stia (c.1406–74), to whom de la Mare ('New research', I, 425–6, 499–500) has attributed over forty manuscripts, two of them signed, and most of them dated; he had previously copied the same text in 1450 (now Vatican, Ottob. lat. 2134; see Merisalo, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, 27–8 no. 5). Merisalo suggests that the present manuscript comes probably from the workshop of Vespasiano da Bisticci (ibid., 33), but de la Mare does not include it in her list of Vespasiano manuscripts (op. cit., I, 555–64). </provenance>

Laurenziana, MS. San Marco 366, which is signed and dated 1449 by the same scribe (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, 44 n. 3; de la Mare, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, 499 no. 10). Ullman &amp; Stadter, Watson, and Merisalo all give variant readings of the erased inscriptions, usually supplying Girolomo's name, but inspection under UV, IR, and blue lights has not clarified the situation. Girolamo bequeathed London, BL, Add. MS. 14798 (written by our scribe), and Harley MS. 2630 to San Marco (Ullman &amp; Stadter, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, 43–4).</provenance>
                  <provenance>The <orgName key="org_169654564" role="fmo"> Dominican convent of San Marco, Florence </orgName>, probably after 1500, since the manuscript does not appear in the San Marco inventory of that date (Ullman &amp; Stadter, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, 44): erased inscriptions on fols. 1r and 1v have been read variously as, e.g. (fol. 1v): 'Iste liber est conuentus s(an)c(t)i Marci de Florentia ord(inis) pred(icatorum) ab heredibus ... de Panzano de[?] Florentia' (this reading based on a note in the hand of R. W. Hunt).</provenance>
                  <provenance>Unidentified 18th-century Italian collection: inscribed in an 18th-century Italian hand in ink (fol. i verso): 'Codex Saec: XV | Codex iste nitidissimus idem | est, quem Auctor Nicolao V. | obtulit, habemus editum | inter Opera Poggij' (apparently in the same hand as a similar note in Bodleian Library, MS. Add. C. 139, which was owned by Libri (see below), so presumably they both came from the same source). The inscription is similar to those of Antonio de Santo (on which see J. B. Mitchell, 'Trevisan and Soranzo: some Canonici manuscripts from two eighteenth-century Venetian collections', <title>Bodleian Library Record</title> 8 no. 3 (1969), 125–35, esp. pl. XV), one of the librarians of Jacopo Soranzo (1686–1761), many of whose manuscripts passed to Matteo Luigi Canonici (1727–1806), and thence to the Bodleian in 1817; although the binding resembles some other Canonici bindings, but there is no clear evidence that the present manuscript was ever owned by him.</provenance>

                  <provenance>Unidentified English 19th-century owner: inscribed with an ironic comment in pencil, below the 18th-century ink flyleaf inscription (fol. i verso): 'This note is quite correct, with the exception that this is not the copy presented to Nicolas V. and that it is not printed in the works of Poggio.'; the tone is reminiscent of notes inscribed by William Beckford in his books, but the hand is probably not his.</provenance>
