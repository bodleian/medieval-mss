This is also indicated by the prices on the first recto pages of Parts I–IV and VI: fol. 1r, ‘ij s.’; fol. 13r, ‘iij s.’; fol. 21r, ‘iij s.’; fol. 36r, ‘val. iij s.’; fol. 51r, ‘iij s.’ These are presumably the retail prices of the individual booklets.</collation>

                     <handNote script="hybrida">Parts I and II were written by <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, a semi-cursive hand of the mid-fourteenth century. This scribe writes above the top line of the frame.</handNote>
                     <handNote script="cursivaAntiquior">An Anglicana business hand <hi rend="italic">B</hi> was, at various times, responsible for several parts of the manuscript: <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></hi> wrote Part III fols. 21ra–26vb (No. 5, Sacrobosco <title>De sphera</title>); <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></hi> wrote Part IV fols. 36ra–44rb to near the end of No. 10 (Odoric of Pordenone); in Part V <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></hi> wrote the first two items (Nos. 11–12, fols. 46ra–48va) and <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">4</hi></hi> wrote the next two (Nos. 13–14, fols. 48vb–50va); in Part VI <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">5</hi></hi> wrote No. 44 (fols. 68rb–71va), followed by <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">6</hi></hi> who wrote Nos. 45–47 on fols. 71va–74rb. These varieties of <hi rend="italic">B’s</hi> script differ only in size and thickness of ink and are, Rigg believes, by one scribe, writing probably in the later part of the fourteenth century (certainly after 1330, the date of No. 10).</handNote>
                     <handNote script="cursivaAntiquior">Another Anglicana hand, <hi rend="italic">C<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></hi>, augmented Part III and wrote Nos. 6–9 on fols. 27ra–30rb; No. 9 was completed by a similar but distinct hand, <hi rend="italic">C<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></hi>, on fols. 30va–35ra.</handNote>
                     <handNote script="textualisNorthern">In Part IV, where <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></hi> had left the text of No. 10 incomplete on fol. 44rb, a fifteenth-century hand <hi rend="italic">D</hi> completed it and finished on fol. 45rb.</handNote>
                     <handNote script="textualisNorthern">The original poems of Part VI (the collection related to Bodley 603) were written by two hands, also late fourteenth-century: <hi rend="italic">E<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></hi> (fols. 51ra–58ra, Nos. 15–23) writes a Textura, with ‘biting’ and a habit of drawing doodles and small faces from the ascenders on the top line; <hi rend="italic">E<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></hi> (fols. 58rb–68ra, Nos. 23–43) is similar to <hi rend="italic">E</hi> but without the doodles.</handNote>
                     <handNote>One hand, <hi rend="italic">F,</hi> wrote the fifteenth-century Parts VII–VIII.</handNote>
                     <handNote>Titles (where supplied) are usually by the scribe who wrote the text (as in Part I), but that on fol. 13r is by a somewhat later hand. The title of No. 13 (fol. 48vb) is perhaps by the fifteenth-century hand <hi rend="italic">F</hi>.</handNote>
                     <handNote>At the foot of fol. 51r (perhaps referring to No. 16) is written ‘amonicio quedam ut caueamus male age’ (? agere, agendo); at the foot of fol. 53vb (referring to No. 18) is written ‘incipiunt sermones golie’: these notes may be by the hand which wrote the prices (below).</handNote>
                     <handNote>On fol. 61ra an extra line has been added (see No. 30).</handNote>
                     <handNote>In blank space on fol. 74rb is written: ‘In isto libro continentur: Algorismus prosaicus’; this incipient contents list, written in the fourteenth century, perhaps shows that Part II was once the first booklet in what was by now perceived as a single book.</handNote>
                     <handNote>On fol. 74v is a diagram of the winds and a short extract from Isidore (No. 48).</handNote>

                  <origin>
                     <p>Rigg argues that the volume was assembled in the <origDate calendar="Gregorian" notAfter="1400" notBefore="1370">late 14th century</origDate> from six booklets, purchased from a bookseller; and augmented by another set of booklets in the fifteenth century. He draws attention to the phrase ‘val. iij s.’ on fol. 36r as indicating value rather than copying cost. See Rigg, <q>Medieval Latin Poetic Anthologies (III)</q>, p. 476.</p>
                     <p>The hands of Parts I–VI are of the late fourteenth century. Odoric’s Travels (No. 10) gives a date of 1330; the Battle of Najara (No. 52) notes 1366. Rigg dates hand <hi rend="italic">F</hi> to the fifteenth century. Rigg suggests that the contents point to a university provenance: <q><origPlace cert="low" key="place_7011931">Oxford</origPlace> offers itself as the ideal milieu for the circulation and cross­fertilization of poetic anthologies</q> (p. 505). He notes that Digby 166, Part VI is linked textually with MS. Bodley 603, and that <q>the prose satire in Part V, the additions to Parts III and VI, and the poems of Part VIII bring Digby 166 thematically into association with Cotton MS. Titus A. xx, MS. Rawlinson B. 214, and MS. Bodley 851</q> (p. 469). Andrew G. Watson, ‘Thomas Allen of Oxford and His Manuscripts’ in <title>Medieval Scribes, Manuscripts and Libraries: Essays Presented to N. R. Ker</title>, ed. M. B. Parkes and Andrew G. Watson (London, 1978), pp. 279–314, notes that some of Allen’s Oxford manuscripts <q>may have been in Oxford since long before Allen’s time, having been brought to the University by student monks. … when we consider his Benedictine manuscripts (which are by far the commonest) it is more than tempting to recollect that Allen’s residence, Gloucester Hall, was the descendant of a college which had a special place among houses of the Benedictine order</q> (p. 286).</p>
                     <p>Rigg hypothesizes: <q>a fourteenth-century bookseller offered for sale five booklets: mathematical commentaries (Part I), Peter Dacia on the <title>Algorismus</title> (Part II), Sacrobosco <title>De sphera</title> (Part III, quire iii only), the Travels of Odoric of Pordenone (Part IV, incomplete), and a collection of satirical poems (Part VI). To these he added a collection of prose satire (Part V) in a scrappy booklet of two bifolia and an extra leaf: this was perhaps included in the price of Part IV. As one hand <hi rend="italic">B</hi> was responsible for Parts III, IV, V and the two extra sets of poems in Part VI, this scribe may have been a principal scrivener in the bookseller’s operation. Both Text and Court Hands are found in Digby 166, but the Textura section by hands <hi rend="italic">E<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></hi> and <hi rend="italic">E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></hi> (Part VI, fols. 51–68ra) could have been obtained separately. The fact that the booklets were prepared for, but did not receive, illumination, suggests that they were not commissioned by the purchaser. The bookseller may also have been responsible for the title of No. 4, the notes on the poems (fols. 51r, 53vb), the start of the contents list on fol. 74r, and the added line on fol. 61ra</q> (pp. 471–473).</p>
                  </origin>
                  <provenance>At some stage Part III was augmented by the addition of an extra quire and the ‘Trojan’ entries by hands <hi rend="italic">C<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></hi> and <hi rend="italic">C<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></hi>. The fact that two scribes were involved suggests that this was done while the booklets were still with the bookseller; on the other hand, the removal of the last leaf from quire iii shows that that booklet was once regarded as complete as it stood. Clearly, the addition was an afterthought: the parchment of quire iv is thicker and coarser than that in the rest of Parts I–VI.</provenance>
                  <provenance>In the fifteenth century someone supplied the missing end of the text of Odoric (No. 10) and added an extra bifolium. The quire signatures a–b–c–d–a on quires x–xiv show that Parts VII–VIII were originally quite separate from Parts I–VI, and also that the final quire (Part VIII C) was once the first booklet in a compilation. On the other hand, the union of Parts I–VI with VII–VIII must have taken place in the fifteenth century, especially if the title on fol. 48vb is by hand <hi rend="italic">F</hi>. The whole codex was supplied with quire signatures a–o. By error, fol. 45r was signed T: this is the first leaf of the bifolium attached to quire v to take the missing text of No. 10, but must have been counted with quire vi, which consists of only five leaves.</provenance>
                  <provenance>Throughout the manuscript are various notes and scribbles, such as a student’s notes on fols. 1r and 2r, and the scribe’s notes in No. 5.</provenance>

                        <p>Rigg argues, <q>The main collection of poems in Part VI by hands <hi rend="italic">E<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></hi> and <hi rend="italic">E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></hi> (Nos. 15–43) is closely related textually to MS. Bodley 603, and, to a lesser extent, to Paris, BnF, MS. lat. 3245. Bodley 603 and Digby 166 share nine poems (eight of which are by Walter of Châtillon) in roughly the same order: they are textually very closely related and are cited as ‘alpha’ by K. Strecker, <title>Moralisch-Satirische Gedichte Waiters von Chatillon</title> (Heidelberg, 1929). In <title>Moralisch-Satirische Gedichte</title> No. 4, Bodley 603, Digby 166, and Paris, BnF, MS. lat. 3245 share the ‘Missus sum’ opening characteristic of Strecker’s group Y; in <title>Moralisch-Satirische Gedichte</title> No. 1 Bodley 603 and Digby 166 omit 23/4–6 and leave a gap. On the other hand, neither Bodley 603 nor Digby 166 is copied from the other (date also rules out the possibility of B’s being copied from Digby 166): each manuscript had access to poems not contained in the other: <title>Moralisch-Satirische Gedichte</title> Nos. 2 and 11 (in Bodley 603 but not in Digby 166), and 16 and 18 (in Digby 166 but not in Bodley 603); Digby 166 lacks the 16-line prologue to ‘Ante chaos iurgium’ but has several stanzas not in Bodley 603 (but in the Grey’s Inn MS. used by Giles). Close textual examination of <title>Moralisch-Satirische Gedichte</title> Nos. 1,3,4 and 5 and ‘Ante chaos iurgium’ provides many examples of each manuscript diverging from a supported reading of the other. Clearly, Bodley 603, Digby 166, and Paris, BnF, MS. lat. 3245 are derived independently from an earlier Walter of Chatillon collection. Digby 166’s No. 17 and 27 are in other manuscripts. Surprisingly, none of Bodley 603’s poems is in any manuscript other than Digby 166.</q></p>
                        <p><q>The additions to Part VI by <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">5</hi></hi> and <hi rend="italic">B<hi rend="superscript">6</hi></hi> (Nos. 44–47) are all very common in the later Goliardic manuscripts. In no case is there clear evidence for textual relationship: in No. 47 (‘De coniuge non ducenda’) Digby 166’s text is in a quite different tradition from the family in British Library, Cotton MS. Titus A. xx; MS. Rawlinson B. 214; MS. Bodley 851; British Library, MS. Cotton Vespasian E. xi; Cambridge, Trinity College, MS. O.9.38; and MS. Add. A. 44.</q></p>

Ed. Olga Dobiache-Rojdesvensky, <title>Les poesies des Goliards</title> (Paris, 1931), pp. 127–30 from the 1557 edition by Flacius Illyricus (identical in order of stanzas to that printed by John Bale, <title>Scriptorum illustrium maioris Brytanniae … catalogus</title> (Basel, 1557), 1.262–63 from a text supplied by John Pullan of Oxford). In comparison with this edition Digby 166 has: stanzas 2–4, 7, 5, 9–12, 6, one illegible stanza, 8, 11 (repeated), 13. This is similar to the order found in British Library, MS. Harley 200, fol. 144r, which has 2–4, 10–11, 7, 5, 9. The text printed by Wright, <title>Mapes</title>, pp. 171–73 is a conflation of Flacius’ text and Harley 3724, and gives an inaccurate account of what each text contains.</note>
