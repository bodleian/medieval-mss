                  <summary>The surviving portions of the first volume of <title>The Orrmulum</title>. It contains biblical narratives and homilies. An incomplete list of pericopes, between Orrm's Dedication and Preface, shows that at least 242 biblical narratives, each followed by a homily, were planned. The manuscript is Orrm's autograph, and contains numerous insertions, deletions and revisions in his hand.</summary>

Cols. 69–76 must have contained the end of Fit 2 and the beginning of Fit 3; some 30 septenaries survive in Vliet's transcription. Matthes (1933, p. 42) treats the homily on Lk 1:26 as a separate item, now completely lost. Since the quire signatures preclude the loss of a whole quire between Quires 3, 4, the lost text can only have occupied cols. 69–76 and any inserted slips, now lost. As a result, it is unlikely this homily could be any longer than c. 200 septenaries. An alternative would be to imagine a double homily, from which both paraphrases and the exposition of the first pericope have been wholly lost. </note>

Most of fol. "119" has been torn away, leaving the end of the homily imperfect. Matthes suggests Fit 24 (a homily on Jn 4:5) begins between ll. 20019–20036, but the text is so imperfect at this point that it is impossible to be sure. The text printed by Holt-White as ll. 20053–69 is no longer visible in the manuscript.</note>

Its structure is now extremely complex due to Orrm's insertion of 29 slips of vellum containing revisions (indeed, the manuscript may once have contained further slips, now lost) and the loss of at least thirty-four leaves, mostly since the columns were numbered in the seventeenth century. Since the losses are mostly complete bifolia, it is likely the manuscript was unbound at this time.

Word division is not always a priority. One feature of Orrm's unique orthographical system is his use of geminate consonants; these generally indicate the preceding vowel is short, unless that vowel is in an open syllable. To economise the space this system requires, Orrm sometimes stacks the second consonant of a pair on top of the first consonant.</p>

                     <p>Malcolm Parkes has suggested Orrm wrote the text at the Augustinian Abbey of Bourne in Lincolnshire. His evidence comes from the list of capitula, which indicates that the latter stages of Orrm's work focussed heavily on the deeds of SS. Peter and Paul. Bourne was dedicated to these two saints, and the dialect evidence supports placing the work in this part of Lincolnshire. Parkes dates Hand C's addition of the Latin pericopes early in the final quarter of the twelfth century. Nils-Jennart Johannesson has suggested that it would have taken Orrm four or five years to copy out the five volumes which it seems constituted the full text.
