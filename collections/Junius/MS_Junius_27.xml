                        <note> Calendar, mutilated, laid out one month per page, written in black,
                           not graded, approximately one-third full, combining verse entries with
                           prose entries of a liturgical calendar: out of some 126 entries, 27 are
                           in verse, closely related to the Metrical Calendar of Hampson (McGurk,
                           1986; Gretsch, 2001, ‘Junius Psalter gloss’, p. 289). The inventory of
                           saints is similar to 10th- and 11th-century Winchester calendars and the
                           Metrical Calendar of Hampson (Bishop, 1918, pp. 254–5; Temple, 1976, p.
                           39; Gretsch, 2001, ‘Junius Psalter gloss’, p. 289; McGurk, 1986,
                           discusses the differences with the Metrical Calendar, such as the
                           omission of Irish saints). Includes Valentine (14 February), Patrick (17
                           March), Augustine of Canterbury (26 May), Benedict (11 July), obits of
                           King Alfred (26 October) and his queen Ealhswith (5 December), all apart
                           from Augustine in prose, but all also present in the Metrical Calendar.
                           Additions of calendarial material, including verses on the ‘Egyptian’
                           days (Hennig, 1955, set III and another set which differs from all sets
                           published by Hennig) at the top of each month; notes ‘dies mala’ marking
                           unlucky days in the right margin and astronomical notes in a 12th-century
                           hand. </note>

                        <note> Psalms (Roman version), beginning imperfectly at 2: 4 (Qui habitat in
                           cælis . . .) and ending at 144: 6 (. . . terribiliorum tuorum dicent). A
                           stub survives with a frag- ment of a decorated Beatus-initial. A leaf
                           after fol. 67, containing 67: 28–68: 7, is lost; initials of psalms 1,
                           28, 39, 44, 50, 51, 68, 77, 80 and 140 are excised. Each verse starts on
                           a new line and the Latin text is accompanied by a continuous interlinear
                           gloss in Old English, beginning ‘se eardað in heofonum . . .’ and ending
                           ‘þinra eyes fulnessa cweoðað’ (see Brenner, 1908, pp. xiii–xxxiii; Sisam
                           and Sisam, 1959, pp. 55–6; Gretsch, 2000). Punctuated sporadically, with
                           the ends of verses and minor pauses marked with the medial point, and
                           metrum marked with the medial point or punctus elevatus. The psalms are
                           preceded by short titles, which do not correspond to any of Salmon’s
                           (1959) series (often ‘In finem psalmus dauid’), and usually by their
                           numbers in Roman numerals. The numbers are not used for the gradual
                           psalms, 119–133, each of which has a title ‘Canticum graduum’ (fols.
                           134r–140v). Some numbers are out of sequence, e.g. fols. 101v and 144r,
                           though the psalm sequence is correct. There are textual divisions at
                           psalms 17, 26, 38, 51, 52, 68 (?), 72, 80, 97, 101, 109, 118 and 119 (see
                           ‘Decoration’). The scribe left blank spaces or filled the remaining space
                           with titles in large script before psalms 38, 51, 101, 109, 118 and 119
                           in order to begin these on a new leaf or page. Subdivisions within psalms
                           are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, with 2- to 3-line decorated
                           initials and Latin names of Hebrew letters in red at the start of
                           16-verse units, and slightly enlarged 1-line initials and the names of
                           Hebrew letters at the start of 8-line units. Fol. 150 is a blank paper
                           fly-leaf. The opening words of the adjacent verse are copied in the
                           margin on fol. 116v and the letters of the alphabet ‘abcdef’ are added in
                           light brown ink in the margin on fol. 117r. Psalms 2: 2–3: 3 are added in
                           the margin of fol. 10r in a 12th-century hand. </note>

                           115v). Initial D at psalm 109 (fol. 118r) is decorated with geometric and
                           floral designs, and two birds’ heads; inside its loop is David pulling
                           apart the jaws of a lion.</p><p>According to Wormald (1984, p. 57) the
                           initials may be the work of the artist who also executed the initials at
                           the beginnings of the first five books in the ‘Tollemache Orosius’
                           (London, British Library, Add. MS. 47967). According to Temple (1976, p.
                           39) the decoration can be attributed to Winchester because of its
                           similarity with London, British Library, Cotton MS. Galba A. xviii, and
                           Oxford, Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 484, fol. 85 (‘Æthelstan
                           Psalter’).</p></decoNote>
