                     <binding notAfter="1692" notBefore="1617"><p>Late seventeenth-century calf binding over pasteboards typical of Elias Ashmole's style, with <q>ASH. 45</q> embossed on the central spine panel. The spine is covered in a separate piece of leather from the boards, of the same colour, that extends under the board-covers. The head, tail, and panels of the spine display horizontal concentric tool framing. The spine shows four raised sewing supports covering thick cords which support all four composite parts - three of these cords are intact. The sewing stations do not follow any of the original sewing stations in the composite parts, which show evidence of between five and six stations from previous bindings. This is typical of Ashmole's binding style. However, the spine-cover has likely been replaced since the manuscript left Ashmole's collection. The typeset of the shelf mark is similar, but not identical, to Ashmole's typeset (varying in the height of letters and thickness of vertical strokes in characters <q>A</q> and <q>4</q>), and Ashmole's embossed crest is missing from the second panel (see e.g. MS Ashmole 44). The board-covers also show evidence of having been lifted up at the spine-edge to allow for the spine-cover to be adhered beneath them.</p> 
                        <p>Due to the varying heights of the composite units, there are no endbands. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels. The boards are cut according to the largest codicological unit, with wide squares. Both boards display concentric frame tooling which is flush with the border on three sides and inset from the spine-border by several centimeters, as is typical of Ashmole's bindings. The absence of the usual concentric frame tooling on the spine side is likely due to cropping of the leather when the new spine-cover was added. The board edges are tooled with a repeating zig-zag pattern typical of Ashmole's bindings. The inner rear board bears an inscription typical of the Bodleian's in-house bindery, with the initial <q>W</q> and the date, partially obscured, <q>24 - 1<gap/> - 51/7</q>. This is likely the work of A. G. Wintersgill, who was employed at the Bodleian for the finishing, furbishing, and repair of bindings from 1949, and whose initials can be seen on other Ashmole bindings (e.g. MS Ashmole 1431). </p></binding>

               <history>
                  <provenance/>
                  <provenance>The four composite parts were likely compiled and bound together by <persName key="person_27215170" role="fmo">Elias Ashmole</persName>, who is responsible for the current binding of the manuscript. Their selection was likely made based on the size of the codicological units, rather than their content. The marking up for prior sewing stations is visible in all four parts and does not suggest that any of these parts shared a binding before the current volume.
                     <p>Ashmole bequeathed the manuscript in its current condition to the Ashmolean Museum in 1692, in one volume, as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</p></provenance>
                  <acquisition>The manuscript was kept in the Ashmolean until 1860, when the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library.</acquisition>

                        <note>MS Ashmole 45 is one of four surviving copies of <title key="work_11674">The Earl of Toulouse</title> (with Bodleian Library, MS Ashmole 61; Cambridge University Library, MS Ff 2.38; and Lincoln Cathedral, MS 91). The poem is thought to have been composed in the north east Midlands in the last half of the fourteenth century. This copy shares a textual tradition with MS Ff 2.38, which also contains a variant reading of the passage in which a ring is presented by Beulybon (lines 1017-76); see Hurley (2020), p.212.
                           <p>Carol M. Meale dates this copy to the late 1520's and links the style of the presentation picture to a Flemish family of artists, the Horenbouts (see Meale, 1996, p. 226). </p>
                           <p>The letters <q>M. D.</q> appear twice, once after the title on folio 2r (see <q>Decoration</q>) and again after the explicit on folio 31v (see <q>Provenance</q>).</p>

                        <handNote script="cursivaAntiquior">Two hands. <title key="work_11674">The Earl of Toulouse</title> is in a neat anglicana of the first half of the sixteenth century. Features are two forms of two-compartment <hi rend="bold">a</hi>: a variety with parallel sides and horizontal cross bar with a scooped stroke forming the head (used mid-word), and a variety that resembles an upper case graph with angular body and looped head (used for the indefinite article and word-beginning); looped <hi rend="bold">d</hi> with angular lobe and long trailing tag when in final position; two compartment <hi rend="bold">g</hi> with diamond-shaped head; two forms of looped <hi rend="bold">h</hi>: an angular variety with triangular closed head-loop and long curving tail-stroke, and a rounded variety when following <q>t</q> or <q>g</q> where the head-loop follows on from the cross bar of the previous letter; both long and short zetoid <hi rend="bold">r</hi>; and both long and short sigma <hi rend="bold">s</hi> at word-end.
                           <p>Several speculations can be made about the nature of the scribe's copying.  The strapwork initials are characteristic of legal and government scribes in London in the 1520's and 30's (see Perkins, 2015, p. 1; Meale, 1996, p. 226). The quality of the script and consistency of the hand (despite the lack of ruling) also suggest an individual experienced in copying long-form codices. A significant degree of planning  was required for the layout and mise-en-page to ensure that every iteration of <q>Leve we now</q> coincided with the first line of the page.</p>
                           <p>Works by William Fitzwilliam are autograph, in a messy secretary script of the sixteenth century. Features are single compartment <hi rend="bold">a</hi>; long diagonal <hi rend="bold">f</hi> with trailing descender; both long and short <hi rend="bold">s</hi>; and unlooped <hi rend="bold">y</hi> with exaggerated right-curling descender. Multiple stints in varying shades of ink can be identified throughout.</p></handNote>

                        <decoNote type="miniature">Folio 2r contains a fine miniature, uncoloured, of a male figure, possibly the author or donor, presenting a lavishly bound book to a lady. The <ref target="https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/objects/99752f8c-69af-42d9-92dc-0c6920d289b1/surfaces/a9fd517b-455d-4f2e-8fb8-b5978bbfe447/">miniature</ref> is executed in ink and brown wash, typical of Flemish illustrations of the early sixteenth century. A banderole, or text scroll, extends from the male figure reading <q>prenes : engre</q> (<q>take with pleasure</q>). Folio 2r marks the start of the text with both the title of the poem and this ink drawing, visually recalling a printed title page.
                           <p>A monogram beneath the miniature reads <q>Maid Maria</q> - this has previously been interpreted as the manuscript's recipient (see e.g. Meale, 1996). The image marks the opening of the <title key="work_11674">The Earl of Toulouse</title>, with the rubric <q>The Story of the Erle of Tolous</q> written above the miniature.</p></decoNote>
                        <decoNote type="decInit">The text opens with an elaborate seven line decorated initial <q>I</q> with ornate flourishing and strapwork on folio 3r, which contains the name <q>mo - rga - nus</q> - the Quarto Catalogue suggests this is the name of the scribe. The first two words of the text following this initial are copied in a larger display script. The phrase <q>Leve we now</q> is demarcated throughout the manuscript. A five line initial, in the same style at folio 3r and followed by the display script, marks the first line of folio 14v (line 475) <q>But leve [we now]</q> - this is not typically a point of textual division, but does mark a moment in which the narrative progresses. The display script, without indentation or flourishes, is used for <q>Leve [we now]</q> (the first word of the page) on folios 7r, line 163; and 22r, line 803.</decoNote>

                     <provenance>Clues to the identity of the scribe of <title>The Earl of Toulouse</title> are seen in the opening and closing of the text. The name <q><persName role="scr" key="person_4977">Morganus</persName></q> is recorded in a banderole incorporated into the opening initial of the text (fol. 3r), and the initials <q>M. D.</q> are recorded in the explicit (fol. 31v). It is unclear whether the letters <q>M. D.</q> that appear after the title on folio 2r relate to the scribe or recipient of the manuscript.</provenance>
                     <provenance>The identity of the patron of <title>The Earl of Toulouse</title> is unknown, but the nature of the decorated title page and presentation scene suggests this component was a bespoke comission, possibly intended for a female recipient. Meale speculates from the clothing of the figures in the frontispiece that the patron belonged to the wealthy mercantile class, who may have comissioned the volume for a prospective wife (Meale, 1996, p. 230). </provenance>
                     <provenance>The presence of an additional quire after <title>The Earl of Toulouse</title>, which remained unused by the scribe, suggests that this was intended to be a larger production with multiple texts. It is likely that the two texts in this composite part have always belonged to the same codicological unit: they share the same paper stock with one consistent watermark, and all quires have been marked up for sewing with pinholes in the same positions, in an arrangement that pre-dates the current binding. This composite part was formerly bound as the last (or possibly only) item in a volume that used recycled parchment end leaves. The reversed impression of a cropped fragment of an earlier parchment leaf, possibly thirteenth century, can be seen on the verso of the last folio of this codicological unit. Impressions from two clasps or similar furnishings with woven ties can also be seen on this folio.</provenance>
                     <provenance>This composite part was in the possession of <persName role="fmo" key="person_4976">William Fitzwilliam</persName> by March of 1602, due to the note on folio 2v in which he records his marriage: <q>my <damage agent="damp">cossen</damage> Willyam dyear was mared <lb/> the 17 daye of marche 1602</q>. He also annotates the blank folios 1v, 2v, and 31v-41r. Fitzwilliam's autobiographical notes describe his career in London as an apprentice to Richard Waddington, Master of the Merchant Tailors in 1548. He spent time in Antwerp in exile, in Scotland during the final English campaign in 1549, and Ireland in the service of his relative Sir William Fitzwilliam, Treasurer of Ireland (See Hunter, <title>South Yorkshire: History and Topography</title>, 1974.). He identifies himself as the sixth son of John Fitzwilliam of Sprotborough, Yorkshire. William Fitzwilliam is possibly identified as a member of the Fitzwilliam branch based at Gaynes Park, Chigwell, Essex (see Meale, 1996, p. 233). </provenance>
                     <provenance>The folios were later owned by the poet <persName key="person_18015860">William Brown(e)</persName> (1590-c. 1645), who records his name on folios 2r and 3r: <q>W. Browne</q>. Brown(e) typically placed his ownership marks on the first folios of a manuscript, however due to the composite nature of the manuscript, only this first part can be associated with Brown(e) with any certainty. See Edwards, 1997. </provenance>
                     <provenance>This composite part was later owned by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> (1617–1692), who acquired other manuscripts from Brown(e), for instance MS Ashmole 59 and MS Ashmole 40.

                     <provenance>Due to the damaged and fragmentary nature of this part, there is little evidence of provenance. The cropped name <q>Willia<ex>m</ex> S<gap reason="cancelled"/></q> is written vertically in the margin of folio 41r in a later hand, possibly seventeenth century. An erased inscription is present at the end of the Table of Contents on folio 68v, possibly also the hand of the pen trials on folio 42v.
                        <p>This composite part has been significantly cropped on the upper and outer margins, occasionally with the loss of text.
