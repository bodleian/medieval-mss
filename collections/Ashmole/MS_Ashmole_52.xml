Folios 27–30 and 35–38 show evidence of much larger textura script that has been removed, possibly originating from a liturgical manuscript (illegible under UV). Ryley describes this recycling as <q>exceptionally carefully executed</q> (Ryley, 101).</support>

                        <p>There are two clasps anchored to the upper board with two pins, on leather fore-edge flaps which are reinforced with parchment. Each clasp contains Ashmole's coat of arms. The facing catch plates are anchored to the lower board with two pins. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels.</p>
                        <p>The spine shows no raised sewing supports, but the inner boards reveal four sewing stations. The spine is decorated with six rows of the same semi-circle design as the board edges. The spine shows Ashmole's crest in gold and the shelf mark <q>Ash: 52</q>There are no end bands. The edges of the pages have been stained red - also typical of Ashmole's bindings.</p>

                  <provenance>The front and back flyleaves are recycled from sixteenth century account records from Devon, cut down from much larger pages. It is dated 'quarto die octobr<ex>e</ex> anno xxi reg<ex>nante</ex> <damage></damage> but the name of the monarch is trimmed. This could refer to the twenty first year of Elizabeth's reign (1578-9). It mentions the name John Clyfton, who was sheriff of Devon in 1580. The document also mentions the names Bridgewater, Beaford, Bulkeworthy, Bydelcombe, Lancras, and Paynton. Lancras, Beaford, and Bulkeworthy are all parishes in the same part of Devon (see TNA E 117/2/7/fo29). These three parishes are mentioned in earlier documents as the property of Giles Daubney de Daubney, knight, in 1504-5 (see TNA CP 25/1/294/81, number 129).</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was later owned by <persName key="person_27215170" role="fmo">Elias Ashmole</persName>, who is responsible for the current binding of the manuscript. Ashmole is known to have recycled parchment for his bindings (see for instance MS Ashmole 396), so it is possible he is responsible for bringing together this manuscript with its flyleaves. He does not mention acquiring the manuscript in his diary or correspondence.</provenance>
                  <provenance>It was bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum by <persName key="person_27215170" role="fmo dnr">Elias Ashmole</persName> in 1692 as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</provenance>
                  <acquisition>The manuscript was kept in the Ashmolean until 1860, when the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library .</acquisition>
