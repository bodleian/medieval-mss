                     <note>The text opens with a table of contents (fols. 1r - 3r) listing the titles of the 88 chapters, in the scribe's hand. The prologue, consisting 9 stanzas, occupies folios 3v - 4v. The poem, consisting 833 stanzas, begins at the top of folio 5r and ends on 109r, accompanied by the usual Latin glosses. Lines II.987, III.141-168, VI.210-216 omitted. Lines I.354-355, II.1246-1247, III.1514-1515, and V.586-587 transposed. <p>The <title key="work_2725">Life of Our Lady</title> is extant in 42 manuscripts. The Ashmole copy belongs to Group d of the textual tradition, and shares an exemplar with British Library, Harley MS 4011 - see Joseph A. Lauritis (1961), pp. 12-17.<ref target="https://www.dimev.net/Results.php?imev=2574">IMEV 2574</ref>.</p></note>

However, though the hands are certainly contemporary there are inconsistent graphs between the Ashmole hand and Brode's hand, for instance: the Ashmole tight anglicana <q>g</q> vs Brode's hour-glass secretary <q>g</q>, the Ashmole long <q>r</q> that opens at the baseline vs Brode's long <q>r</q> that is open from the bottom, the Ashmole sigma <q>s</q> with long horizontal extension in final position vs Brode's narrow sigma <q>s</q>, the Ashmole downwards flourish to the <q>of</q> crossbar vs Brode's short crossbar, and the Ashmole single-stroke ampersand vs Brode's ampersand with suspended crossbar. Instead, it is likely that the two scribes are contemporary and trained in a similar milleiu, but are not the same individuals.

                     <p>Post-medieval parchment over original boards with bevelled edges, which sit flush with the edge of the text block. The boards display evidence of two former clasps, likely bar clasps, of which only the catchplates with two pins remain on the left board. The outlines of the catchplates are visible through the surface of the parchment. The right board contains two matching indentations for the corresponding catchplates, now lost. The parchment pastedowns also show evidence of prior clasps, with damage that aligns with the placement of the catchplates and vestiges of rust. The outline of metal corner fittings can be seen through the parchment on both boards, and a vertical row of six metal pins can be seen on the outer edge of the right board.</p> <p>The spine shows four raised double sewing supports with equal spacing. The sewing supports are laced through the boards in four holes, travel through an indented channel in the inner face of the board to two holes (forming a V shape), and exit to be plugged with a dowel or wedge.</p> 
                        <p>The shelfmark <q>ASH: 39</q> is embossed into a separate piece of red leather that has been adhered to the centre panel of the spine - possibly taken from a previous binding. The typeface and use of colon is not consistent with the binding style of Elias Ashmole, and was possibly added by the Ashmolean Museum after his donation. The manuscript lacks end bands and the boards sit flush with the edge of the text block.</p>

                  <provenance>The parchment pastedowns contain several names in fifteenth and early sixteenth century hands which suggest an early provenance in Hertfordshire. <q>T Bourchier</q> and <q>Anne Bourgchier</q> are named on both pastedowns, identifiable as <persName role="fmo" key="person_3962">Sir Thomas Bourchier of Knebworth (c.1437-26 October 1491)</persName> and his wife <persName role="fmo" key="person_3963">Dame Anne Bourchier, née Andrews (c.1445-25 July 1520)</persName>. Thomas Bourchier was the Constable of Leeds Castle. The name <q><persName role="sgn" key="person_3964">Isabell Bourchier</persName></q> is also recorded on the rear pastedown - likely Thomas Bourchier's first wife Isabel Bourchier, née Barre (c.1453-1489). Thomas and Isabel married in 1472, making it likely that the Bourchiers acquired the manuscript between 1472 and 1489.
                     <p> Thomas Bourchier's matching signature also appears in a Latin psalter, now London, British Library, Royal MS 2 B XIV (folio 135r). This manuscript was likely executed for Isabella, sister of Richard Duke of York and wife of Henry Bourchier, 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Earl of Essex in the mid fifteenth century. Thomas Bourchier inherited the manuscript in the 1480's as Henry and Isabella's fifth son. A later hand in the calendar records the obituary of Isabella Bourchier on 1 March 1489, and the dates of birth of two of their children, Isabella (24 April 1474) and Johanna (18 March 1479). 
                     </p>
                     <p>The name <q><persName role="sgn" key="person_3965">Sir William Rous knyght</persName></q> is recorded twice on the front pastedown - possibly Sir William of Rous of Dennington, Suffolk (b. by 1471), who was knighted on 9 September 1513. Rous was patronized by the Duke of Norfolk and was a member of Parliament from at least 1523.</p>
                     <p>The name <q><persName role="sgn" key="person_3966">Richard Blomvyll</persName></q> is recorded on the rear pastedown and partially erased - possibly Richard Blomvile, esquire, of Gunton St Peter, Hempnale and Newton Flotman (d.1503).</p></provenance>
                  <provenance>The provenance until the mid 1600s is uncertain. The manuscript was owned by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> (1617–1692), who signs his name in the top outer corner of folio 1r. Ashmole may have acquired the manuscript because of his interest in the Bourchier family, whose heraldry he records in 1658; see MS. Rawl. D. 682, f. 2v, and C. H. Josten (ed.), <title>Elias Ashmole</title>, vol. 2, p. 740. The unstained parchment binding over original boards and recycled parchment sewing guards are not typical of Ashmole's binding style, and so it is likely that the manuscript was in its present condition when he acquired it.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> in 1692 as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</provenance>
                  <acquisition when="1860">It was kept in the Ashmolean until 1860, when the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library.</acquisition>
