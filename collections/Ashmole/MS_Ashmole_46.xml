                     <note>These texts survive in thirteen manuscripts and fragments (excluding those copied by John Stow); for a comprehensive list, see Bale and Edwards (2009, 11-18). Although distinct texts, <title>The life of St Edmund</title> and <title>The life of St Fremund</title> are predominantly paired together in surviving witnesses, excluding the fragment Exeter Devon County Record Office Misc. Roll 59. The <title key="work_2727">Miracles of St Edmund</title> occur alongside the saints' lives in only 2 other manuscripts: Bodleian Library MS Tanner 347, Oxford Corpus Christi MS 61. There is one witness that comprises the Miracles without the saints' lives: Bodleian Library MS Laud Misc. 683. Both of the lives and the miracles are edited in <title>John Lydgate's Lives of Ss Edmund &amp; Fremund and the Extra miracles of St Edmund</title>, eds Anthony Bale and A. S. G. Edwards (2009).</note><note>The Lives are catalogued together as DIMEV 5422.</note>
                     <note>The present manuscript is unique in replacing references to Henry VI with Edward IV and also differs somewhat from other manuscripts in its <foreign>ordinatio</foreign>, arrangement of contents, and text; the differences are summarized by C.

                     <handNote script="cursivaAntiquior">Anglicana Formata with Secretary influence, in a consistent professional hand of the late fifteenth century. Typical double-compartment <q>a</q>, looped ascenders on <q>d</q>, <q>l</q>, <q>b</q>, and <q>h</q>, and sigma-shaped <q>s</q>. The <q>g</q> closed with a separate crossbar and the angular looped <q>d</q> with a triangular lower lobe suggest a hand with Secretary influences of the second half of the fifteenth century, perhaps the third quarter. <p>In their edition of Lydgate's <title>Lives of Ss Edmund and Fremund</title> (2009), Anthony Bale and A.S.G. Edwards identify this scribe's hand in two other fifteenth century manuscripts of this text: British Library, MS Yates Thompson 47 and an un-numbered manuscript owned by the Duke of Norfolk. Bale and Edwards suggest this scribe was based in Bury St Edmunds, either within the Abbey or in a secular environment.</p> 
                        <p>Kathleen Scott identifies a total of ten manuscripts containing this hand, which she dubbs the 'Edmund-Fremund scribe', all containing works by Lydgate (<q>Lydgate's <title>Lives of Saints Edmund and Fremund</title></q>, 1982). Four of these are copies of <title>the Lives of Saints Edmund and Fremund</title>. There is ongoing debate regarding the full extent of the scribe's contribution to British Library MS Harley 2255.</p>
                     <p>The Quarto Catalogue suggests the manuscript shares a scribe with the presentation copy of <title>The Lives of Ss Edmund and Fremund</title>, British Library MS Harley 2278, however a comparison of the scripts suggests they were copied by different individuals, although likely in the same environment in Bury St Edmunds. MS Harley 2278 can confidently be dated to between 1434 and 1444 (due to its connection to Henry VI and his sojourn at Bury St Edmunds Abbey in 1434), whereas MS Ashmole 46 suggests a date of several decades later after 1461 (due to the replacement of references to Henry VI with the name of Edward IV). The dates therefore also make it unlikely that these two manuscripts shared a scribe.</p></handNote>

                  <decoDesc>
                     <decoNote type="other">Bale and Edwards suggest the artists who decorated MS Ashmole 46 also decorated British Library, MS Yates Thompson 47 and an un-numbered manuscript owned by the Duke of Norfolk, which also share a scribe with MS Ashmole 46. They also note similarities in the decoration of British Library MS Harley 2278 (the presentation copy of <title>The Lives of Ss Edmund and Fremund</title> for Henry VI). Scott (1982) adds to this list British Library MSS Sloane 2464, Harley 1766 (folios 42v-99r), and Harley 2255 (folios 113v-153v) - manuscripts which also contain the hand of the <q>Edmund-Fremund scribe</q> (see <q>Hands</q>). Scott also identifies this artist in British Library MS Cotton Vespasian B.xii, not affilliated with the <q>Edmund-Fremund scribe</q>.</decoNote>
                     <decoNote type="miniature">Fine miniature on folio 1r of a poet (presumably John Lydgate) in monk's habit with an empty scroll kneeling before a king (Henry VI or Edmund IV) who holds an arrow and scepter and sits on a canopied throne. Figures coloured in white, grey, blue, and gold, on a ground of red and green with gold designs. Framed by blue and gold bars on three sides. A similar miniature, in the same style and colours, appears in British Library MS Yates Thompson 47 and the un-numbered manuscript owned by the Duke of Norfolk. The miniature in MS Ashmole 46 is significantly worn over the figure of the poet, likely post-reformation damage provoked by his monk's habit. In comparison with the Yates Thompson and Norfolk manuscripts, MS Ashmole 46 is far less lavishly illustrated with only this singular miniature.</decoNote>

                  <p>On the blank folios at the rear of the manuscript (fols. 161r-163v), there are several inscriptions: <q>The wiche other sortes</q> (161r), <q>A man withe out marsi no marsi shall <lb/> haue in tyme of ned when he dothe it <lb/> crave but all his lyive go lick a slaue</q> (?) and <q>Questa altra sorte</q> (162v), <q>The whiche</q> (163r). Folio 163v is now blank but once contained many fifteenth century inscriptions, some of which are legible under UV light: a small drawing of a shield with illegible writing, <q>boke</q>, <q>Clerk</q>, <q>Thomas H<gap/>ll <gap/> at the syne of the hartes heyd</q></p></additions>
                  <bindingDesc><binding notAfter="1700" notBefore="1500"><p>The binding is made of gilt punched leather, using the technique whereby repetitive patterns of geometrical shapes were punched onto the parts of the design that would be left unpainted. It has been coloured with a yellow-gold glaze or tinted varnish, and is decorated with abstract floral designs and a mixture of overlapping punch patterns. On this technique, see Posthuma De Boer, Martine, E. F. Koldeweij, and Roger M. Groves, Gilt Leather Artefacts (2016).</p> 
                     <p>The leather covers paste boards typical of the sixteenth century, and shows remnants of two metal clasps with flower motif pins, which were once attached to leather straps. Comparable hardware can be seen in the bindings of Matthew Parker from the second half of the sixteenth century, now Corpus Christi College Cambridge SP.66, SP.57, and SP.244.</p> 
                     <p>The binding is recycled from a larger piece of punched leather, likely a sixteenth century panelled wall hanging or screen - although the dating of the punched pattern is much harder to determine. Similar designs are found on sixteenth century Italian wall hangings in the V&amp;A Collection (items O304822, O304824, and O369581) which suggest a plausible place and date of origin.</p>
                     <p>Although this leather was prevalent in luxury homes and churches from the sixteenth century, the practice of recycling leather wall hangings into book bindings is a rare phenomenon. A few examples can be found on printed books which were bound in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Italy and Spain. The binding of MS Ashmole 46 represents one of the earliest known examples of this practice, and to date is the only known manuscript with this style of binding. It is also the only example identified thus far in England.</p>
                     <p>The current binding is not the manuscript's original binding, as the text block has been trimmed and the page edges gilded at a later date after its production. This binding was likely made before 1588, as it does not match the style in which Sir Thomas Tresham, who owned the manuscript in 1588, bound his manuscripts with his family crest embossed in the centre of the front cover (see British Armorial Bindings, <q>Tresham, Thomas (1543-1605)</q>, stamps 1, 2, 3). Paper pastedowns, that on the left board with watermark, hand with five-pointed star (or flwoer).</p></binding></bindingDesc>
