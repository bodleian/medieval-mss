                        <note>The outside of the outer sheet (here called recto), which was originally the outermost cover of the book, once contained a part of the author's autograph draft of <title>Sir Ferumbras</title>. In its current folded state, this is the outermost side. This side of the sheet has been substantially worn and discoloured, but shows evidence of erased Middle English script which is still visible on the edges. A few lines of this text carry over to the inside of the outer sheet and are still legible around the margin of the letter executory. It is identifiable as the same hand as the main text of <title>Sir Ferumbras</title> in the codex. The contents and author's corrections of these lines suggest that the poem on this sheet is an early draft of the poem in the codex. </note>

                        <note>The inside of the outer sheet (here called verso) is a letter executory addressed to the Bishop of Exeter and dated to 3 May 1357. It contains the bull of pope Innocent VI for the presentation of Thomas de Silton to the vicarage of Columpton, in the diocese of Exeter. The post was vacant in 1357 after the death of Peter Moleyns. The bull is addressed to the Abbots of Schirbourne and Cerne and to John de Silvis, dean of the collegiate church of St Agricola in Avignon.</note>

                     <provenance>The wrapper's original purpose as a bull of the diocese of Exeter suggests the parchment would have first been deposited in the city of Exeter soon after 1357. S. J. Herrtage notes that this is not a document which would have been carefully preserved by the cathedral, but equally that it would not have travelled outside of the diocese, and therefore it is probably that the <title>Sir Ferumbras</title> poet was a clergyman in Exeter who would have had access to unwanted parchment documents held by the cathedral.</provenance>

                        <note>The outside of the inner sheet (here called recto) contains a long and imperfect public announcement in Latin dated 1377, pertaining to the chapel of Holne, in the diocese of Exeter. It describes a disagreement between the rector Roger Langman and the vicar John Brygge over a burial ground adjacent to the chapel. In its current folded state, this side comprises both the inside and outside of the wrapper.</note>

                        <note>The inside of the inner sheet (here called verso) contains 392 lines of the author's autograph draft of <title>Sir Ferumbras</title>. Like the outer sheet, it appears to be an earlier draft of the text. As this side of the parchment was on the inside of both the fold and the outer sheet, it is remarkably preserved and legible, although faded in parts. The verso contains 4 large columns of text, equivalent to two and a half pages of the codex. It has been trimmed from a larger sheet of parchment on the left and lower margin which resulted in the loss of text.
                        <p>The discrepancy between the inner sheet draft and the codex draft are substantial, with differences in orthography, vocabulary, and even the phrasing of verse. As with the codex, the draft is heavily corrected by the same hand. </p></note>

The translation is not faithful to the original, but the narrative content of many lines is maintained. The author's corrections of the text suggest this is a working draft. The text is incomplete fue to the loss of the first leaf and the outer pair of leaves belonging to the last quire. The dialect is of Exeter, Devonshire identified by Richard Beadle.</note>

                              <note>Beneath the last stanza on fol. 77v are four lines of verse, each pair bracketed with a line of verse in the right margin (as above). The text is partly illegible, even under Ultraviolet light, and is written in the scribe's hand but in a lighter shade of ink. A later hand has traced over some of the letters in a darker ink. Similar marginal verse additions are on fols. 32v, 33r, 69r, 71v, 72r-v, and the same ink is used for interlinear corrections throughout. The scribe also leaves Latin editorial instructions, presumably to himself, in the margins (for instance, 'ponatur in loco isto' on folio 77v).</note>

                           <provenance>The provenance of the two parchment wrappers, and the identification of the poem's dialect to Exeter, point to an Exeter origin. for the manuscript. They also suggest a date of the last quarter of the 14th century, after 1377, for the main text, which was written after the earlier drafts which appear on the parchment wrappers. S. J. Herrtage's suggestion of a clergyman author is probable, as the poet would have had access to papal documents and a manuscript of the Old French poem <title>Fierabras</title> from which he was translating, and would have been sufficiently educated to be litterate in French, English, and Latin.</provenance>
