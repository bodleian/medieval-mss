Text expanded: 11,020/9,526 lines. Belongs to the Main Version of <title key="work_13981">The Prick of Conscience</title>, Group II. A member of the so-called Lollard subgroup, which contains two interpolations and one rearrangement with an attack on the clergy, Latin prose also incorporating anti-clerical sentiment, and the transferal of some text from Book V (6346-409) to the end of Book VII (between lines 9474 and 9475) - on this group see Allen, 1927, pp. 387-94.

                        <p>Late seventeenth-century calf binding over pasteboards, typical of Elias Ashmole's style, rebacked. The edges of both boards are decorated with concentric tool framing, with triple tooling on the margin closest to the spine on both boards. The board edges are tooled with a repeating semi-circle pattern, also typical of Ashmole's bindings.</p> 
                        <p>The spine has been rebacked, and shows five raised sewing supports covering thick cords which support both composite parts. The shelf mark <q>ASH. 60</q> is embossed on the central spine panel. The typeset of the shelf mark is similar, but not identical, to Ashmole's typeset (varying in the height of letters and thickness of vertical strokes in characters <q>A</q> and <q>H</q>), and Ashmole's embossed crest is missing from the second panel (see e.g. MS Ashmole 44). The board-covers also show evidence of having been lifted up at the spine-edge to allow for the spine-cover to be adhered beneath them. </p>
                          <p>The sewing stations of Ashmole's binding do not follow the original sewing stations. There is evidence of a prior binding that included at least seven sewing stations.</p>
                        <p>There are no end bands. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels. The board edges are tooled with a repeating zig-zag pattern typical of Ashmole's bindings. The inner rear board bears an inscription typical of the Bodleian's in-house bindery, with the initial <q>H</q> and the date, partially obscured, <q>3 - 12 - 00</q></p>
