                     <note>imperfect at the beginning because of the loss of one leaf, starting at Wednesday of the second week after the octave of Epiphany. Includes the temporal and commemorations only, which suggests that the table may have been originally preceded by a calendar-lectionary (see MS. Selden Supra 51 and Solopova, <title>Manuscripts of the Wycliffite Bible</title>, introduction, ‘Liturgical materials’). The entries consist of the name of the liturgical occasion in red, abbreviated reference to a book and chapter of the Bible, an indexing letter in red, the opening words of a reading, <q>ende</q> in red, the closing words of a reading and double strokes in red. The entries for Old Testament readings are also accompanied by letters and numbers in the margins in red, used to identify the readings in the Old Testament lectionary (see below). Larger initials with penwork at Ash Wednesday and Ascension. Commemorations are in the following order: Our Lady, Trinity, Holy Ghost, cross, angels, <q>salus populi</q>, brothers and sisters, peace, clear weather, rain, in time of battles, <q>a priest for hym silf</q>, pestilence of beasts, pilgrims, sinners, sick, dead and weddings.</note>

                     <note>Imperfect at the beginning and end because of the loss of leaves. Also missing are the end of Matthew (after 27:62) and the beginning of Mark (before 1:11); the end of Mark (after 16:9) and the beginning of Luke (before 1:30); the end of Luke (after 24:51) and the beginning of John (before 1:19); the beginning of Romans (before 2:13). The leaves at the start of books were undoubtedly removed because of the illumination they contained: at the beginning of Mark and Luke there are fragments of leaves with illuminated borders, and there are offsets of illumination on fol. 27r (the beginning of Mark) and fol. 64r (the beginning of John) which used to face the missing leaves. All prologues to the gospels are missing, otherwise usual prologues. Running titles in black preceded by blue paraphs on both rectos and versos, consisting of abbreviated titles of biblical books. Usual rubrics in red; chapter numbers as red Roman numerals or words. Blue paraphs at the start of sections within the text. Indexing letters in the margins entered at the start of lections, rather than consistently; double strokes at the ends of lections. Many drawings of hands pointing at the text in the margins, including some marking passages of possibly Lollard interest, such as Matthew 23:14. Corrections in the original or contemporary hands; longer omitted passages are added in the margins often enclosed in decorative frames embellished with penwork. Alternative translations (e.g., fols. 24r, 52v, 64v, etc.) are occasionally written out in the margins. Added material within the text is underlined in red in the epistles.</note>

                     <note>Imperfect at the beginning because of the loss of one leaf. Includes readings for the temporal, commemorations, proper and common. Only the first four readings for commemorations and the last three readings for the proper are preserved, because of a missing quire after fol. 187. The readings are preceded by rubrics in red, introductory statements (e.g., <q>The lord seiþ þes þingis</q>, fol. 166r) underlined in red, and numbers. The lectionary is subdivided into five sections marked with letters A, B, C, D, E in the upper margin. References for Old Testament readings in the table of lections <locus>(fols. 1r–5v)</locus> are accompanied by letters and numbers, e.g., a1, a2, a3, etc., identifying the section where each reading occurs and its number within the section (a similar system is used in the calendar-lectionary and Old Testament lectionary of MS. Selden Supra 51). Added material within the text is underlined in red.</note>
