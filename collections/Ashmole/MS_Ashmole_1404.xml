                     <note>Three books of the <title>Uricrisiae</title> by Henry Daniel, a Dominican friar who translated the text from Latin into English in 1379 (Moorat 1962). This date of this text is only known from the witness in MS Ashmole 1404. Two versions of this text survive, both ascribed to the author: an earlier shorter text surviving in British Library Arundel MS 42 (alpha), and a longer revised text surviving in Additional MS 27329 (beta). The text in MS Ashmole 1404 belongs to the beta tradition and is known to be the most faithful of this strand. It shares many variants and errors with Wellcome Historical Medical Library MS 225 (Hanna 1994, 191). There are seven alpha, five beta, and eight hybrid witnesses of the text.
                        <p>The text here opens with a Prologue in Latin, which is only found in one other witness: Cambridge, Gonville and Caius, MS 376/596. There are two other Latin versions of the Prologue and one English translation in the corpus, and some manuscripts lack the Prologue altogether.</p>
                        <p>In between the conclusion of the third book and the explicit is an Epilogue consisting of twelve elegiac distichs in Latin, written in alternating lines of red and black with braces (fol. 184r). Some (but not all) alpha manuscripts contain a variant of this Epilogue, and one other beta manuscript (MS 376/596).</p>
                        <p>The text is glossed throughout in Latin with numerous manicules and nota bene annotations.</p>
                        <p>The codex is split in two in the middle of this text, between folios 83v and 84r. Within the text, folio 102 is numbered twice (henceforth 102a and 102b).</p></note>

                        <condition>The manuscript is split into two pieces (see <q>Binding</q>). The sewing is fragile in places. The text block was likely once larger and has been heavily trimmed on at least two sides. Marginal notes have been cropped on the outer vertical margins. It is likely that a large quantity has also been trimmed from the upper margin, as the raised sewing supports are unevenly distributed towards the head of the spine.<p>
                        The spine has, since binding, been adhered to the book block to create a tight-back binding which stabilizes the divided codex. As a result, there is no throw-up when opened and the volumes are difficult to open fully, and should be handled with care.</p><p>
                           The parchment is stained throughout but largely undamaged. There is evidence of parchment tabs which were once adhered to the outer vertical edge of the text block, now removed but with remnants of adhesive remaining. These were present on the majority of pages.</p><p>
                              The lower margin of folio 114 has been mutilated, without loss of text.</p></condition>

The two pieces are now stored in the same box and under the same shelf-mark, but in separate protective folders.</p>
                     <p>Late seventeenth-century binding typical of Elias Ashmole's collection. Brown leather over pasteboard, blind tooled on boards and spine, with four raised sewing supports. Primary sewn endbands of blue and white thread over a core, now lacking the lower endband on the first part of the codex. The spine lacks Ashmole's crest (as is conventional in his bindings) due to the closeness of the bands, but the shelf mark <q>ASH 1404</q> uses the typeface and gold colour typical of an Ashmole binding. </p>

                  <provenance>The manuscript shows evidence of heavy use, especially in the <title key="work_1993">Uricrisiae</title>. The later additions to the diagrams and tables suggest that it was likely owned by an individual who practiced medicine, astronomy, and astrology in the late fifteenth/early sixteenth century who was literate in English and Latin. This hand also annotates the text throughout and adds chapter titles and running titles.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The initial <q>R</q> appears twice (fols. 3r, 14r), perhaps an ownership mark.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was later owned by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName>, who bequeathed it as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts to the Ashmolean Museum in 1692.</provenance>
                  <acquisition>The manuscript was kept in the Ashmolean until the 1830’s, when the Bodleian Library acquired the collection.</acquisition>
