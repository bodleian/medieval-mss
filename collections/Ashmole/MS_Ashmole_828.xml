                     <decoNote type="miniature">36 column miniatures (typically 9-10 lines high) and one larger miniature occupying approximately the top quarter of folio 1r. All executed by the same artist/school. This style has been associated with a group of secular manuscripts produced in northern France, perhaps Thérouanne (see Stones, 1996). Each miniature is encased in a frame of alternating red and blue with white detailing and illuminated corners. The ground is illuminated, sometimes worn away. Miniatures coloured in washes of pale blue, red, green, and orange, with red and black detailing. In the majority of cases, the miniatures appear at the conclusion of a tale with an illustration of the narrative. (For the literary interpretation of these miniatures and their accompanying bas-de-page, see Dover (1997).)

                        <p>Alison Stones attributes the decoration of a group of manuscripts, including MS. Ashmole 828, to a workshop established in Northern France, perhaps Thérouanne (see Stones (2018), p. 205). This group includes Paris, BnF, fr.749; Turin, Biblioteca nazionale Universitaria, L III. 12 and Bologna, Archivio de Stato b.1 bis.n.9.

The edges of both boards are decorated with concentric tool framing. The head, tail, and panels of the spine display the same style of tooling in horizontal frames. The spine shows six raised sewing supports covering thick cords, without endbands. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels. The board edges are tooled with a repeating zig-zag pattern, also typical of Ashmole's bindings.</p> 
                     <p>The binding has been rebacked since the manuscript left Ashmole's collection. The spine is covered in a separate piece of leather from the boards, of the same colour, that extends under the board-covers. The shelf mark <q>ASH. 828</q> is embossed on the third spine panel, in a typeset that is similar, but not identical, to Ashmole's typeset (varying in the height of letters and thickness of vertical strokes in characters <q>A</q> and <q>4</q>). Ashmole's embossed crest is absent (see e.g. MS. Ashmole 44). The board-covers also show evidence of having been lifted up at the spine-edge to allow for the spine-cover to be adhered beneath them. The inner rear board bears an inscription typical of the Bodleian's in-house bindery, with the initials <q>R. H.</q> and the date <q>12-12-56</q>.

                  <provenance>Alison Stones attributes the decoration of a group of manuscripts, including MS. Ashmole 828, to a workshop established in Northern France, perhaps Thérouanne (see Stones (2018), p. 205; 1996).</provenance>
                  <provenance>D. J. A. Ross and Alison Stones later identified a manuscript in Paris: <bibl type="ms"><ref target="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10022284t/f10.planchecontact">Bibliothèque nationale de France fr.749</ref></bibl>, containing the <title>Estoire del saint Graal</title> and <title>Merlin</title>, which they suggest was decorated by the same artist(s) as MS. Ashmole 828 (Ross and Stones, 2002). Monica Longobardi identified fragments of a manuscript in <bibl type="ms">Bologna, Archivio di Stato b.1 bis.n.9</bibl>, that contain miniatures by the same artist(s). She argues these fragments once belonged to a companion volume to MS. Ashmole 828; see Longobardi,(1994). It has not been possible to compare these fragments against MS. Ashmole 828.
                  </provenance>
                  <provenance>The early provenance of MS. Ashmole 828 is unclear. There are no indications of a patron or early owner. The heraldry depicted on the knights' shields (see <q>Decoration</q>) does not appear to relate to any specific family.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The related manuscript BNF fr.749 was likely in England by the fifteenth century, according to an English inscription on folio 338v. It was purchased, in England, by  Louis of Bruges, Lord of Gruuthuse, whose coat of arms appear in the lower border of fol. 1r, and was later gifted to King Louis XII. The inventory of the King's Library in 1518 records <q>(number 68) La destruction de la Table ronde</q>, identified as BNF fr.749 (see Omont (1913), p. 24; and (1908), p. 217). There is no evidence to suggest that MS. Ashmole 828 and BNF fr.749 were circulating together at this point; however, it is the type of provenance one would expect for this quality of manuscript, as the King's Library did contain several manuscripts of the Lancelot cycle alongside the BNF copy (items 2471 and 2440-4, Omont (1908), pp. 381-2;, items 733 and 720, Omont (1909), pp. 299-300; items 522 and 441, Omont (1910), pp. 29, 25; and items 7171 and 7172, Omont (1913), p. 24).</provenance>

                  <provenance>The manuscript was later owned by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> (1617–1692). Roger Middleton speculates that the manuscript was likely acquired by Ashmole in England, rather than a deliberate import from France - however there is no physical evidence to indicate either way (see Middleton, p. 224). Neither the manuscript nor the French Arthurian cycle are mentioned in Ashmole's correspondence or diary.</provenance>
                  <provenance>MS. Ashmole 828 was bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> in 1692 as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</provenance>
