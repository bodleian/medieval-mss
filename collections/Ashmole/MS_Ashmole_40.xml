                  <provenance>The manuscript formerly belonged to the poet <persName key="person_18015860">William Brown(e)</persName>, author of <title>Britannia’s Pastorals</title> (1613–16) and Oxford alumnus (matriculated 30 April 1624). He acquired the book in 1612, noted in his ownership inscription on the first folio: <q>Liber W. Browne 1612</q>. In the same year, he acquired Durham University MS Cosin v.ii.15 and Longleat MS 50 (see A.S.G. Edwards, 'Medieval Manuscripts owned by Browne of Tavistock'). Brown(e) supplied three paper leaves that were excised (fols. 65, 70, 74) two marginal stanzas (fols. 40v, 80r), and missing lines (fols. 7r, 10v, 52v) in his own hand from an unknown exemplar. His annotations to the poem can be seen throughout, and it is likely that he was at one point preparing an edition of the text.<p>Brown(e) also describes Hoccleve in one of his pastorals, <title>The Shepheards Pipe</title> (1614), and owned other manuscripts which contained his works (Durham University MS Cosin v.iii.9, MS Cosin v.ii.13). Brown(e) is thought to have died in 1645, and left no will. It is unclear if the manuscript was still in his possession, and his widow was granted administration of his estate.</p> </provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was later owned by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName>, who signs his name on folio 1r in the upper right margin: <q>E. Ashmole</q>. Ashmole also acquired other manuscripts formerly belonging to Brown(e), now MS Ashmole 59 and MS Ashmole 767, possibly after Browne(e)'s death.</provenance>
                  <provenance>Bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> in 1692 as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</provenance>
                  <acquisition>The manuscript was kept in the Ashmolean until 1860, when the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library .</acquisition>
