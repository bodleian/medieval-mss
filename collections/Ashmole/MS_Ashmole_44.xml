                     <note>The longest and most complete witness of <title>The Wars of Alexander</title>. This version is imperfect, containing lines 1-5803 lines out of a possible 6300 originally. There is one other witness of this text, Dublin, Trinity College MS 213 olim. MS D.4.12, which only preserves a portion of the text (lines 678-3424 and 3485-3553). These witnesses are very similar in their scribal dialect, variants, and content, leading Gert Ronberg to suggest that they may have been copied from the same exemplar (1985, p. 604).
                        <p>123 lines are missing from between lines 722 and 846, containing the end of Anectanabus's speech and the beginning of Alexander's. Hoyt N. Duggan and Thorlac Turville-Petre suggest that this is due to the loss of a singleton leaf which was once attached between folios 12 and 13 (1989, p. x). This lacuna is not noted in Stevenson's 1849 edition.</p>
                        <p>There is a contemporary running title to the text at the head of folio 1r, now faded and illegible.</p>

                  <bindingDesc><binding notAfter="1692" notBefore="1617"><p>Late seventeenth-century calf binding over pasteboards typical of Elias Ashmole's style. The edges of both boards are decorated with concentric tool framing. The head, tail, and panels of the spine display the same style of tooling in horizontal frames. The spine shows four raised sewing supports covering thick cords, without end bands. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels.</p> 
                     <p>The binding has been rebacked since the manuscript left Ashmole's collection. The spine is covered in a separate piece of leather from the boards, of the same colour, that extends under the board-covers. On to this leather, a portion of the former (Ashmolean) spine has been adhered. This piece of leather covers the three central spine panels and raised sewing supports. The shelf mark <q>ASH. 44</q> is embossed on the third spine panel in Ashmole's typeset. Above this is Ashmole's embossed crest featuring his quartered heraldic design. The board-covers show evidence of having been lifted up at the spine-edge to allow for the spine-cover to be adhered beneath them. </p>
                     <p>The inner rear board bears an inscription typical of the Bodleian's in-house bindery, with the initial <q>W.</q> and the date <q>16-12-55</q> - likely the date of the rebacking.</p>

                        Gisela Guddat-Figge suggested an origin of Northern England (1976, p. 246), supported by Duggan and Turville-Petre (1989, p. xxv). <ref target="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/elalme/elalme_frames.html">LALME</ref> describes the scribe's dialect as <q>substantially of Durham, or possibly S[outh] Northumberland, but with odd features of apparently N[orth] W[est] Midland origin</q>. For a detailed analysis of this and the Durham manuscript, see Gert Ronberg (1985).
                     </origPlace>
                  </origin>
                  <provenance>The initials <q>R. R.</q> and <q>R. ANON</q> are written in the lower margin of folio 1r in an early hand, possibly of the fifteenth century. This same hand copies several single and two-compartment <q>a</q> also in the lower margin. Ethel Seaton theorises that this manuscript may have been owned by Sir Richard Roos (c. 1410-1482) because of the similarity to the poetic device <q>I roos anon</q> she identifies in <title>La Belle Dame Sans Mercy</title> (1961, p.111).</provenance>
                  <provenance>There is little evidence for the early provenance of the manuscript. The scribal dialect has been located to the North of England, perhaps to County Durham (see Duggan and Turville-Petre, 1989, p.xxv; and LALME). Duggan and Turville-Petre suggest that the scribe was copying from an exemplar containing West Midland forms, which are visible in scribal errors and mistranslations (p. xxv).</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was later owned by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> (1617–1692). The date at which he acquired it is uncertain, but in a letter dated the 23 January 1656 he writes to Henry Oxinden of Barham, Kent, to say that he will be lending him <q>an Alexander which is true and good</q> (British Museum Add. MS. 28003, fol. 334; edited in <title>Autobiographical and Historical Notes</title>, ed. Josten, vol. 2, p. 687). In his reply of the 6 May 1656, Oxinden acknowledges the receipt of a book on Alexander the Great (British Museum Add. MS. 28003, fol. 341; edited in <title>Autobiographical and Historical Notes</title>, ed. Josten, vol. 2, p. 690).</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> in 1692 as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</provenance>
                  <acquisition>The manuscript was kept in the Ashmolean until 1860, when the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library.</acquisition>
