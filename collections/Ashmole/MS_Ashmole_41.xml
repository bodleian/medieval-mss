                        <p>A more specific binding date can be suggested from the flyleaves. The watermark on the rear flyleaf can be identified as Churchill, 'Foolscap' 348 (1935), dated to 1672 from a manuscript in Worcester Cathedral Library by Churchill. The same watermark appears in Folger Shakespeare Library, C 185, <title>Cabala, Sive, Scrinia, Sacra</title>, printed for G. Bedell and T. Collins in London in 1663.</p>

                  <provenance>The difference in condition and size of the two parts of the manuscript suggests they initially circulated separately and bound together much later. Provenance for each part has been recorded separately.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was later owned by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName>, who signs his name in the upper margin of folio 1r and adds a note to the verso of the flyleaf opposite: <q>This treatise <title>de Stimulo Conscientiae</title> was written by Richard Rolle alias de Hampole, a hermite, who dyed on Mich'as day 1349, and was buryed in Hampole Monastery neere Doncaster in Yorkshire. Vide Baleum fo: 431.</q>. It is likely that Ashmole aquired the two composite parts separately and combined them into one volume when he rebound them in the 1660-70s, as it was his practice to compile multiple booklets.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> in 1692, in one volume, as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</provenance>
                  <acquisition>The manuscript was kept in the Ashmolean until 1860, when the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library .</acquisition>

                     <provenance>LALME locates the dialect of <title>The Prick of Conscience</title> scribe to Staffordshire. The branch of the stemma to which it belongs (IV) contains manuscripts which have been located to Worcestershire and Staffordshire (MV 40: North Worcestershire; MV 31: Lichfield, Staffordshire; MV 36: North Worcestershire; following Britton, 1979), suggesting a possible area of origin for the first part of the manuscript.</provenance> 
                     <provenance>A rhyme written on folio 131r shows that al least the first part of the manuscript (containing <title>The Prick of Conscience</title>) was owned by <persName role="fmo" key="person_3721">Anthony Alderle</persName> in 1567: <q>Antony Alderley ys oner of this boke &amp; ho so ever will say the contrary wytnes I haue of god almity Willam <unclear>Hedge</unclear> will not say the contrary</q>. This rhyme is in the same hand as the rubric and colophon which open and close the text.</provenance>
                     <provenance>A fifteenth-century annotation in the lower margin of flyleaf ii recto, written upside down, records: <q>Swynsdon In Wylt re <gap reason="illegible"/></q>, possibly in the same hand.</provenance>

                     <provenance>This part of the manuscript was likely bound as a single text codex before it was compiled with part 2, as the outer flyleaves show evidence of rust, possibly from clasps, and bookworm damage.</provenance>

                     <additions>Marginal drawings on folios 136r, 137r, and illegible annotations throughout in a cursive hand. Erased inscription in the upper margin of folio 138r in a fifteenth century hand, mostly illegible under UV but possibly begins <q>lyng</q> as if to copy the next line below.
                     <p><title key="work_10903">The Chastising of God's Children</title> is extensively annotated by one hand, in a late-fifteenth/sixteenth century cursive, who leaves annotations in the margins of most folios. The lower and outer margins of folio 148 are filled with three stanzas of verse, unrelated to the main text and thought to be unique: <q>Syns partyng is the caus of peyn <lb/> Wherin can be no stedfast staye <lb/> Suche gr<gap reason="illegible"/> at lengthe may grow agayn <lb/> To led my hert in a happye waye </q>; <q> Why I of partyng do complain <lb/> I shall you tell yf yow wyll here <lb/> I loued un w<abbr>it</abbr>out dysdayn <lb/> Whyche in myn hert I hold so dere <lb/> That yf I had ben lord or kyng <lb/> and al thyngs haue at myn <del>desyer</del> own wyll <lb/> She shold haue ben ladye of everye thyng </q>.</p>
                     <p>Several annotations have been erased or covered with ink, for instance on folios 146v, 153r, and 157r. These annotations were added before this part of the manuscript was trimmed as several are cropped.</p></additions>
