                     <rubric>In the upper right margin of folio 1r is a note in a fifteenth century hand: <q>John Hardyng maker of thyse cronycles</q></rubric>
                     <note>The text in Ashmole 34 descends from Harding's second, unfinished version of the Chronicle, which he was writing at the time of his death c. 1465. The first version was finished in 1457 and is extant in what is thought to be Harding's presentation copy for Henry VI: British Library, MS Lansdowne 204. Harding began work on the second version between Richard, Duke of York's election as heir in November 1457 and his death in December 1460. The second version is extant in eleven other manuscripts, several fragments, and two printed editions of 1543. 
                        <p>As is the case with all manuscripts of the second version, the text in Ashmole 34 also contains a significant number of blank spaces throughout the codex, of both single and multiple lines. The majority of these gaps are likely descended from the incomplete archetype. A few gaps are unique to the manuscript: explicable as spaces left for decoration (e.g. folio 9r, likely for the arms of Brutus; and folio 145v, likely for a depiction of the <q>pedigree unto the crowne of ffraunce</q> mentioned in the text above), or explicable as scribal error (e.g. the probable eye-skip of lines 609, 1115, and 1603). This manuscript also lacks the chapter on the King’s title to his lands, the author’s excusation, and the itinerary of Scotland. Prose passages which are present in other manuscripts of the text (e.g. British Library, MS Harley 661 and Bodleian Library MS Arch. Selden B. 10) are also omitted here.</p>
                     <p>Marginal glosses present in English and Latin, rubricated (as in other manuscripts of the second version).</p></note>

                     <decoNote type="woodcut"> Folio 1v contains a full-page pastedown woodcut, hand-coloured, which depicts a priest with a book and prayer-beads on a blue background. The border has been painted with a thick black paint, but traces of green leaves are visible beneath. In each corner are pasted fragments of parchment with illuminated decoration (likely from a border, of the second quarter of the fifteenth century) in red, blue, green, and gold. These fragments cover four coats of arms which were original to the woodcut, likely in an attempt to repurpose the woodcut for its present context. (<ref target="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000468709">Pächt and Alexander</ref> iii. 1069, pl. C) At the figure’s foot is a shield party per bend sinister argent and gules - comparison with an unmutilated copy of this woodcut in a 1577 edition of <title> Des Hochwirdigen</title> reveals this shield is original. Above the figure is a pastedown strip of parchment which reads ‘The portratvre of Iohn Harding maker of these chronicles’. D.R. Woolf identifies the woodcut as a portrait of the German prince George III, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (1507-1553) by <persName key="person_24706489" role="art">Lucas Cranach the younger</persName>.</decoNote>
                     <decoNote type="heraldry">Heraldic shields are drawn in the margins of fols. 34r (the arms of St George and Constantyne - argent, a cross gules) and 38v (argent a cross gules with bars).</decoNote>
                     <decoNote type="border">Folio 2r opens the text with a six-line illuminated decorated initial, red and blue on gold background, from which extends a two-side spray border with red and blue leaves. Kathleen Scott identifies the limner as the <q>English Illuminator</q> whose work is found in other manuscripts produced in 1470s London, and connects MS Ashmole 34 to a large group of manuscripts (including MS Arch. Selden B.10) which were produced between 1470-80 in the same London workshop.  (<ref>Scott, <title>Later Gothic Manuscripts, 1390-1490</title>, vol. ii, p. 354</ref>).</decoNote>
                     <decoNote type="decInit">Illuminated initials on a blue and red background with white filigree work and spray work extending along the margin on fols. 6r, 8v, 12r, and 100r.</decoNote>

                  <additions>Marginal annotations by several fifteenth to sixteenth century hands throughout in black ink. At least three hands can be identified. The first, neat and upright late fifteenth century hand, marks battles and topographical details. The second, a cursive late fifteenth to early sixteenth century hand, marks key historical events discussed in the text. This hand also adds a note on folio 33r which describes Westminster Hall, suggesting first-hand knowledge of London, and notes an error in the text on folio 40r: <q>This in the romane histories is called maximus not maximianns</q>. The third, a later hand of the eighteenth (?) century, marks the names of some of the kings mentioned in the text.
                  <p>On folio 110r, the initials <q>ROHA</q> are written in the form of a square in the inner lower margin.</p></additions>

                  <provenance>Kathleen Scott identifies the illuminator of the manuscript as the <q>English Illuminator</q>, who was also responsible for decorating the London Skinners' Company <title>Book of the Fraternity of the Assumption of our Lady</title>, which contains the date 1477/8. This evidence, combined with the presence of green lobes in the border decoration, suggests a production date in London in the early 1470s.</provenance>
