                     <binding notAfter="1692" notBefore="1617"><p>Late seventeenth-century calf binding over pasteboards, typical of Elias Ashmole's style. The edges of both boards are decorated with concentric tool framing. There are two clasps anchored to the upper board with three pins, on leather fore-edge flaps which are reinforced with parchment. Each clasp contains Ashmole's coat of arms. The facing catch plates are anchored to the lower board with three pins. The board edges are tooled with a repeating zig-zag pattern, also typical of Ashmole's bindings. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels.</p>
                     <p>The spine shows five raised sewing supports covering thick cords, without end bands. The binding has been rebacked since entering the Bodleian's collection, and only the second spine panel (containing Ashmole's coat of arms with gold tooling around the margins) remains, now adhered to the spine covering in the same place. The spine is now covered in a separate piece of leather from the boards, of the same colour, that extends under the board-covers. The panels on the spine are decorated with the same style of concentric tool framing as the boards. The shelf mark <q>ASH. 396</q> is embossed on the third spine panel, in a typeset that is similar, but not identical, to Ashmole's typeset (varying in the height of letters and thickness of vertical strokes in characters <q>A</q> and <q>9</q>). The signature <q>W 2.2.57</q> is recorded on the inside of the lower board, likely the date of rebacking and initial of the bookbinder.</p> </binding>

                  <history>
                  <provenance>The three composite parts were likely joined together soon after their production, as a single set of medieval leaf signatures is visible across all three parts.
                     <p>The composite parts were likely bound with the recycled end leaf by <persName key="person_27215170" role="fmo">Elias Ashmole</persName> (1617–1692), who is responsible for the current binding of the manuscript. This selection was likely made based on the size of the codicological units, rather than the relevance of their content.</p>
                     <p>Ashmole collected astrological material, especially treatises with tables of lunar phases or relating to the zodiac, such as MS Ashmole 6, 8, 186, 188, 191, etc.</p>
                     <p>Ashmole bequeathed the manuscript in its current condition to the Ashmolean Museum in 1692, in one volume, as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</p></provenance>
                  <acquisition>The manuscript was kept in the Ashmolean until 1860, when the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library.</acquisition>

                           <note>The front flyleaf of the volume is a recycled parchment indenture dated 1608. It relates to a William Treng<gap reason="cancelled"></gap> of London and Robert Danvers, gentleman, and describes an agreement which has passed down from Danvers father, William Danvers. It relates to lands called Lavermore and Maidenheth in Cookham, Berkshire, and the Manor of Ives.

                        <provenance>Owned by <persName key="person_27215170" role="fmo">Elias Ashmole</persName> (1617–1692). In volume 3 of his <title>Antiquities of Berkshire</title>, Ashmole records that the estate of the manor of Ives includes these lands (p. 80, 1719) - this indenture is possibly his source for this information. It is unclear when this flyleaf was added to the volume, but it was certainly before 1692.</provenance>

                           The explanatory notes to the planetary tables is ordained for the meridian of Oxford <q>where þe moder of v<ex>er</ex>tues haþe ordeyned hir to dwelle &amp; to teche her chosen childerin</q>. The tables are possibly an adaptation of the <q>Oxford Tables</q>, a set of astronomical tables compiled for the meridian of Oxford by William Batecombe with radices for 1348 following the Parisian Alfonsine Tables. The use of Oxford does not necessarily mean that the text was copied there.
                           <p>This composite part was possibly in the possession of Sir John Zouche, or someone related to him, in the mid sixteenth century. The blank folio 69v has been annotated in a sixteenth century hand with a note in Latin on the astrological date and time of the birth of the son of Lord John Zowche on 10 December 1564. This likely refers to <ref target="https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/zouche-john-1564-1610">John Zouche</ref> of Codnor, Derbyshire (1564-1610), who was Justice of the Peace for Derbyshire by 1594-5.

                           <note>The only known Middle English translation of Ashendon's <title>Summa de accidentibus mundi</title>. The text establishes the qualities and natures of the planets and zodiac signs through which accidents are determined (in four chapters, fols. 92r-100v), followed by an electionary (101r-125v). It is split into seventeen parts with three-line blue lombardic capitols with red flourishes, occasionally accompanied by a rubric (see <q>Decoration</q>). The second part contains nine integrated tables and one full-page table (fol. 109r). The same hand as item 8 has numbered the paragraphs and tables from 1-29. On this text in MS Ashmole 396, see Means (1992).
