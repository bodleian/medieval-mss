                     <title type="desc">Added calendar in English</title>
                     <note>In a 15th-century hand somewhat later than the hand of the biblical text, laid out one month per page, written in red and black.</note>
                     <note>Presumably unfinished: there are very few feasts in black in August, September and December. January is headed by a Latin verse on the ‘Egyptian’ days which corresponds to Hennig, J., ‘Versus de mensibus’, <title>Traditio</title> 11 (1955), pp. 65–90, set III. February is headed by a note in English on the number of days in the month. Contains many late 15th-century additions in English which supply the missing Sarum feasts and provide references for lections, consisting of abbreviated titles of Old Testament and New Testament books, chapter numbers and indexing letters. David and Chad (1 and 2 March) are in the original hand, but John of Beverley (6 May) and Winifred (3 November) are added, suggesting a date before or around 1415 (see Pfaff, R. W., <title>The liturgy in medieval England: a history</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), pp. 438–41). Also added are Visitation (2 July, promulgated in 1481), Transfiguration (6 August, promulgated in 1457), Francis (4 October) and deposition of Osmund (4 December, canonised in 1456). The feast and translation of Thomas Becket (July) are crossed out.</note>

                     <note>Usual rubrics, e.g., <q>Here endiþ þe gospel of mathew and bigynneþ þe prolog of mark</q>, <q>Here endiþ þe prolog of Mark and bigynneþ þe gospel of Mark as Ierom seiþ pleynli þat þis is þe firste chapiter þis in þis wyse</q>
                        <locus from="50r" to="50v">(fol. 50r–v)</locus>. Prologue to Matthew occupies a separate leaf <locus from="7r" to="7v">(fol. 7r–v)</locus>, the second column on its verso is left blank. Running titles are usually in black (sometimes in red) on the rectos, or occasionally on both rectos and versos, consisting of abbreviated titles of biblical books. Chapter numbers in red, usually as Roman numerals in the form <q>vi c<ex>apitulum</ex></q>, some preceded by paraphs. Many chapter numbers are not filled in by the rubricator and added in black ink as Roman numerals. Corrections in the original or contemporary hands; omitted passages frequently supplied in the margins. No marginal glosses; added material within the text is not underlined. Indexing letters surrounded by double strokes in the margins mark the beginnings of lections; the ends of lections are only occasionally marked with double strokes. Further indexing letters and occasionally notes stating a liturgical occasion for a reading are added in the margins, and the beginnings and ends of readings are marked with special signs within the biblical text, probably by a late 15th-century hand that made additions to the calendar. On fol. 100r the passage <q>But wo to ȝou farisees þat tiþen mynte and ruwe &amp; eche erbe &amp; leuen doom &amp; þe charite of god</q> (Luke, 11:42–3) is marked with a bracket by the same (?) late 15th-century owner.</note>
