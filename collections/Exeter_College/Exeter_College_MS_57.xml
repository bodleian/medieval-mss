                  <summary><p>Exeter College MSS 51–68, most of the texts in which are by or attributed to Hugo de Sancto Caro, were produced in Oxford for <persName key="person_4337" role="dnr">Roger Keys</persName>, d. 1477, whose many positions included the visitorship of Exeter College (1442), the wardenship of All Souls College (1443–5), the archdeaconry of Barnstaple (1450), and the precentorship of Exeter Cathedral (1459) (see <title>BRUO</title>, ‘Keyes’). His arms are found in the borders of several of the manuscripts (although others have been excised) and several manuscripts include a long <hi rend="italic">ex dono</hi> inscription (see MS 53<!-- below and Plate 4-->) recording his gift of the books to the rector and fellows of Exeter College on 1 January 1469/70. On Hugo de Sancto Caro see E. Mangenot, <title>Dictionnaire de théologie catholique</title>, vii (Paris, 1921), 221–308. For two other great series of illuminated volumes produced in Oxford contemporaneously with these, then and now at Balliol College and Merton College, see K. L. Scott, ‘Two series of dated illuminated manuscripts made in Oxford 1450–64’, <title>Watson Essays,</title> 43–69.</p>
                     <p>So far as is known from the incomplete series of dated colophons and the <hi rend="italic">ex dono</hi> inscription, the manuscripts were written between 1452 and the late 1460s, but it is probable that they were delivered to the College singly or in twos or threes; a 1458 entry in the Rector’s Accounts records payments to <persName key="person_4309">John Godysson</persName>, stationer, for providing chains for three volumes of the set (Boase<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>, 21, Boase<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, 40). Another series of entries in the Rector’s Accounts reveals, however, that MS 68 and another, probably MS 60, were not completed until after Keys’s death, between 1480 and 1484, perhaps for lack of money until that was supplied by M. <persName key="person_4344">John Combe</persName> (see <!--below, also -->Watson, <title>Exeter</title>, p. 85, and MS<!--S 60 and--> 68, History).</p>
                     <p>In the whole series three principal scribes took part, assisted by several others in the last volume, MS 68. Four artists shared the illumination of the borders (and some of them also the spray decoration and small initials). For detailed analysis, see Watson, <title>Exeter</title>, pp. 85–87.</p></summary>

Two straps held by nails. Refurbished in the 19th century (1839?): that volumes were resewn is indicated by the very tight binding, which makes collation difficult, and by the provision of new endbands; edges were stained red; book was reinforced by pasting long strips of canvas round the spine and attached to the boards, and the old spines were replaced. Sewn on seven bands. There are remains of only one of the two straps, and three of the five tacks that held the lower strap have been lost.
