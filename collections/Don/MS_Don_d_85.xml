                        <p>In the most recent and most detailed study to date, Scott, <title>Later Gothic MSS.</title>, ascribes the original MS. to a group of Psalters, and a Wycliffite commentary on the Psalter, made under the influence of <persName key="person_612" role="art"><!-- not found VIAF -->Johannes</persName>, the artist of MS. Bodley 264. In a detailed study of the style and iconography, she points out that the Calendar and main Psalter texts were decorated in one style, probably early in the second decade of the century, by her 'Hand B', whose other works she tentatively attributes to London; the initial and border on fol. 11r she dates c.1420–30 – partly on the basis of the costume worn by the kneeling youth – and compares the style to that of London, BL, Arundel MS. 302, which is of East Anglian origin - a localisation which would fit with a Norfolk (Whetenall) patron. The full-page miniatures she dates to c.1430–50.</p>
                        <p>As might be expected, one of the most worn and dirty pages in the volume is the start of the Canon of the Mass <locus>(fol. 108r)</locus>, but since the facing page <locus>(fol. 107v)</locus> is very clean by comparison, it is likely that at least one further leaf, quite possibly with a Crucifixion miniature, was once present between these pages (cf. the Missals described by Scott, <title>Later Gothic MSS.</title>).</p>
