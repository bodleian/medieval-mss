                     <note>With usual prologues. Includes two prologues to Romans and a second prologue to Luke, found in only two other manuscripts (see Dove, M., <title>The first English Bible: the text and context of the Wycliffite versions</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 233): <q>Forsothe for many men enforsiden to ordeyne þe telling of þingis. whiche ben fillid in us. as þei þat sayen at þe begynnyng. &amp; weren mynystris of þe word bytooken: it seyn also to me hauynge fro þe bygynnyng alle þingis deligently bi ordre to write to þee þu best teofile þat þu knowe þe treuþe of þoo wordis of whiche þu art lernd</q>.</note>
                     <note>Some prologues appear to have been added in spaces left for them after the biblical text was copied. Two prologues to Romans, <q>First us bihoueþ vndirstonde…</q> and <q>Romayns þe whiche lyueden in þe citee…</q>, are written in a very small script by the main scribe to fit on fol. 92r–v. The prologue to 1 Thessalonians is written in the margin by the main scribe. The prologue to the Apocalypse occupies about one third of fol. 164r; the rest of the page is left blank and the Apocalypse starts on fol. 164v. According to Lindberg (1994), p. 24, the text is very much revised and strongly influenced by the Later Version of the Wycliffite Bible. Extensive glosses in the margins from 1 Corinthians 6:4 to Jude, some unique, according to Forshall, J. and Madden, F. (eds), <title>The Holy Bible … in the earliest English versions made from the Latin Vulgate by John Wycliffe and his followers</title>, 4 vols (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1850), most found only in this copy and London, British Library, Harley MS. 5017. Fewer glosses in the Apocalypse. The introduction of glosses coincides with the use of a much smaller script for the biblical text (from fol. 109v, 1 Corinthians 7) which remains small in the rest of the volume. Added material within the text is consistently underlined in red throughout.</note>
                     <note>Rubrics in red or black, usually at the start of prologues, though sometimes also at the beginnings of books, e.g., <q>Here endiþ marc and bygynneþ luc þe prologe</q>; <q>luc þe first chapitre</q>
                        <locus>(fols. 45v–46r)</locus>. Running titles consisting of the name of a book and chapter number, usually on both rectos and versos, sometimes preceded by red or blue paraphs. Many corrections in a contemporary hand, over erasures or in the margins; some text crossed out in red ink, particularly glosses within the text and alternative translations at the beginning of Matthew. Some deletions at the beginning of Matthew suggest stylistic editing (see Forshall, J. and Madden, F. (eds), <title>The Holy Bible … in the earliest English versions made from the Latin Vulgate by John Wycliffe and his followers</title>, 4 vols (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1850), vol. 1, p. lii).</note>
                     <note>Chapter numbers in black ink by the scribe in the margins, most as Arabic numerals, some underlined in red or preceded by paraphs; chapter numbers in Roman numerals added in a darker ink. The same hand (15th century, second half (?)) also added indexing letters in the margins at the beginnings of lections, double strokes at the ends of lections, and sometimes notes concerning liturgical occasions when the lections were appointed to be read (e.g., <q>S Andrew day</q>, fol. 5v). Added <q>nota</q> and pointing hands in the margins.</note>

                     <p>Some prologues were added after the text was completed in spaces left for them. Glosses were added after the text was completed and flourished – they avoid penwork initials and chapter numbers in the margins, but the decision to include them was probably made when the volume was planned – the scribe uses a much more compressed script starting with 1 Corinthians 7, the first book to include extensive glosses.</p>
