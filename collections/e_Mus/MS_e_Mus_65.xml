                           <item>(fol. 82v) God of Love meets the Barons in council planning the war. They are dressed in
                              helmets and tunics, first holding battle-axe and sword and gold belt, others carrying
                              shield, spears, and belt, and sword. (line 10.681).</item>
                           <item>(fol. 95r) Dressed as Dominican and nun, False Seeming and Forced Abstinence approach
                              Slander who sits in wait for the Lover outside the castle gate (line 12,147).</item>
                           <item>(fol. 97r) The repentant Slander kneels at the feet of False Seeming, who promptly grabs
                              him by his throat and cuts out his tongue (line 12,361).</item>
                           <item>(fol. 98v) After Conventionality (the Old-Woman) has agreed to act as go-between for the
                              Lover, she eventually finds Comradery (Fair-Welcome) at the top of the tower leaning
                              over the battlement (line 12555). </item>
                           <item>(fol. 99v) Comradery (Fair-Welcome) is most reluctant to accept the Lover’s gift of a
                              caplet, but Conventionality (the Old-Woman) forces it on him (line 12689). (Fair-Welcome
                              is wrongly depicted as a young girl, possibly the heroine herself, instead of a young
                              'bachelier'. Jean de Meung from his treatment of the Lover’s gift also appears
                              unmindful of this fact, though the Old-Woman continues to address Fair-Welcome as
                              'Beaus fiz'). </item>
                           <item>(fol. 100r) Conventionality encourages Comradery (the Old Woman and Fair Welcome, as a
                              girl) to put on a caplet, a gift from the Lover, and she admires its effect in a mirror
                              she is holding (line 12727). </item>
                           <item>(fol. 102r) Conventionality teaches Comradery (the Old Woman and Fair Welcome, as a girl)
                              her theory of love (line 13,001). </item>
                           <item>(fol. 103v) Suicide of Dido (line 13198). Dido impales

                           <item>(fol. 115r) True to her promise Conventionality (the Old Woman) comes down from the tower
                              to tell the Lover she will leave the postern gate open so that he may visit Comradery
                              (Fair-Welcome) (line 14694).</item>
                           <item>(fol. 116r) The Lover declares that his sole desire is to possess the Rose: as he advances
                              towards it the protector, Reserve (Danger) rushes out with his club raised (line 14827).
                             </item>
                           <item>(fol. 120r) Frankness engages in single combat with the protector of the Rose, Reserve (
                              Danger) who has his club raised and carries a shield with a black griffin; she is almost
                              overcome when Pity comes to help her (line 15303). </item>
                           <item>(fol. 124v) Nature strives to contravene the work of Death by multiplying the species
                              (line 15,893). Man and woman together in bed, semi-circular chair beside bed, chest at
                              foot of bed, floor covered in mat of plaited straw. </item>
                           <item>(fol. 127v) Genius is hearing the confession of Nature: she laments her one great fault,
                              the giving of life to men who constantly transgress her laws (line 16285). </item>
                           <item>(fol. 131r) Nature and the Lover. Nature explains how
                              God created the world (line 16729). Four trees. Small patch of blue sky with moon, sun
                              and stars. </item>
                           <item>(fol. 152r) Genius, dressed as a bishop, urges the assembled company to obey Nature’s laws
                              and thus ensure the continuity of the human race (line 19505). His sermon, the eighth
                              digression, occupies a further two thousand lines. To those who follow Nature’s commands
                              he promises Paradise. On those who disobey he pronounces sentence of anathema. </item>

                              Pygmalion in short tunic leans over a table. He models the statue using a chisel, other

Most of the notes seem to have been written by Peter Courtenay (fl. 1573), others by his eldest son John (who probably signs, fol. ii), others by Peter's second son Edward (d. 1622), who probably signs on fol. 1 and perhaps annotates the miniatures towards the beginning of the manuscript.
