                  <summary>An illuminated ‘second-family bestiary’, as edited in Willene B. Clark, <title>A Medieval Book of Beasts</title> (2006), which gives variants from this manuscript under the siglum <q>B</q>. It gives chapters in a different order to the edition, similar to the related London, British Library, Harley MS. 4751. The manuscript also contains numerous interpolations, most but not all also found in Harley MS. 4751. The text draws heavily on <persName key="person_803890">Isidore of Seville</persName>, <persName key="person_4944345">Hugh of Fouilloy</persName>, and <persName key="person_67260463">Gerald of Wales</persName>.</summary>
