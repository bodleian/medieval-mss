                        <p n="desc">One hand. An English vernacular minuscule of the twelfth-century, which retains features of the first half of the century, such as headless <q type="character">a</q> and tapered ascenders still upright. Insular <q type="character">g</q> is used throughout, whilst insular <hi rend="italic"><q type="character">s</q></hi> alternates with long <q type="character">s</q> and no ligatures appear to be used. The writing is regular and large in aspect. Ker argued that this manuscript was 'not well written' (<ref target="#ker44">Ker 1957</ref>, p. 359), but the scribe controls his or her hand throughout the quires, spacing minims and individual letters well. The height of the minims is regularly 3 mm. The prayer at the end is written most likely by this hand. Sedgefield suggests that: <q>A close examination decides against the identity of two hands, which however may belong to the same school of handwriting</q> (<ref target="#kin368">Sedgefield 1890</ref>, p. xv). The hand of the prayer is different in aspect, because the scribe seems to write faster and pays less attention to the formation of the individual letters and the pen is cut with a thinner nib, but it is very likely that these two types of script belong to the same scribe. Probably this text was copied at a later stage, but certainly at the same time as the corrections were inserted. Brown Ink.</p>

D. 98 (see <ref target="#mad369">Madan 1895–1953</ref>, n. 2079, p. 201) contain a fourteenth-century copy of the <hi rend="italic">Digest of Justinian</hi> (bks 19, 20) in a large hand.

These leaves were bound separately in 1884. They were acquired according to Madan not later than 1602.</p>
