                     <note>The entries for readings consist of the name of the liturgical occasion, a reference to a part (in red) and chapter (in black) of <title>Oon of Foure</title>, followed by the first letter of the reading. The opening or closing words are not included. The table consists of the temporal, sanctoral (with a rubric <q>Here bigynneþ þe sanctorum</q>) and commemorations. The sanctoral is similar to those in the manuscripts of the Later Version of the Wycliffite Bible (Forshall, J. and Madden, F. (eds), <title>The Holy Bible … in the earliest English versions made from the Latin Vulgate by John Wycliffe and his followers</title>, 4 vols (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1850), vol. 1, pp. 683–97) and has larger red initials at Andrew’s day and eve, Conception of our Lady, Candlemas, Matthew the apostle, Annunciation, Philip and Jacob, ‘Hooly rode’ in May (Invention of the Cross), ‘Midsomer day’, John and Paul, Peter and Paul, Mary Magdalene, Lawrence, Assumption, Bartholomew, Nativity of our Lady, ‘Hooly rode’ in September (Exaltation of the Cross), Matthew, Michaelmas, Luke, Simon and Jude, All Saints. Commemorations are in the following order: Our Lady, Trinity, Cross, Holy Ghost, angels, <q>at masse for breþeren</q>, peace, king and queen, <q>to gete þe hooli gost</q>, a man for himself, <q>to axe þe grace of þe hooly gost</q>, <q>ffor synnes &amp; repentours</q>, <q>ffor tribulacioun of herte</q>, the sick, rain, <q>forr clerete of eyr</q>, <q>ffor tyme of bateil</q>, <q>ffor him þat is in boondis</q>. <q>Weddings</q> added after <q>Amen dico</q> at the end.</note>

                     <note>Starting with a Prologue with a rubric <q>þe prolog on a book maad of þe four gospelers</q> (ed. Smith (1985)).

                        <locus>(fol. 8r)</locus>. Part and chapter numbers in red. Running titles in red containing part numbers, usually as Roman numerals. Corrections by the original scribe in the margins. References to chapters in the gospels by the original rubricator at the beginning of each chapter, and sometimes elsewhere in the text. The beginnings of readings are marked in red in the text, and the first letter of each reading is written in the margin in red. A gloss within the text is underlined in red on fol. 94v; no marginal glosses.</note>

                     <title key="work_10470" type="desc">A personal collection for reading (?), consisting of extracts from most epistles, followed by extracts from Deeds <locus>(fol. 96vb)</locus>, one short extract from the Apocalypse <locus>(fol. 97va)</locus> and extracts from the Old Testament <locus>(fol. 97va)</locus> in the Earlier Version of the Wycliffite Bible</title>
                     <note>Includes some very short passages (one or two lines long), as well a complete book (1 Timothy, fols. 85v–88r). The extracts from epistles follow the order of epistles in the New Testament, whereas the extracts from the Old Testament have a thematic organisation. The focus of the Old Testament extracts seems to be on the moral and religious law, covering such subjects as the ten commandments <locus>(fols. 97va–102ra)</locus>, including the worship of images <locus>(fols. 97va–8ra, 104ra)</locus>, the fear of God <locus>(fols. 102va–b)</locus>, kingship <locus>(fols. 102vb–103va)</locus>, false gods <locus>(fols. 103va–104ra)</locus>, priesthood <locus>(fols. 105va–106va)</locus>, offerings <locus>(fols. 106va–107rb)</locus>, sins <locus>(fols. 108ra–111ra)</locus>, and wealth, poverty and alms <locus>(fols. 115vb–116ra)</locus>. There are no extracts from the gospels, which suggests that the collection was designed for this copy or its archetype, and was meant to complement <title>Oon of Foure</title>. Notes in Latin in a 15th-century hand in the margins, some simply saying <q>nota</q>, others drawing attention to the content of the passage, e.g., <q>nota de sepulcris</q>, <q>de superbia</q>. Fragments of parchment bookmarks throughout.</note>
