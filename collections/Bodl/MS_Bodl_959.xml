                     <title key="work_15600" type="desc">Old Testament (earlier Wycliffite version)</title>
                     <note>Genesis–Baruch 3:20 in EV with usual prologues, including
                        Jerome’s prefatory epistles (Plate 5). Ends with ‘…þe place of hem risen þe
                        ȝunge’. Lacks the beginning of Judith (1:1–4:16) and the prologue to Judith
                        because of the loss of a leaf after fol. 210. Commendation of Ezra is inserted
                        in the lower margin of fol. 191r. Most books start on a new leaf; psalms
                        start on the verso of a new quire, though the prologues to psalms are in
                        the preceding quire. Two pages (fols. 232v–233r) are left blank before the
                        start of psalms. Approximately a third of a column is left blank on fol. 4r at
                        the end of Jerome’s prefatory epistles and before the beginning of Genesis.
                        Rubrics in red or black in English or Latin. Running titles in red or black,
                        some only on the versos, others on both sides of an opening, consisting of
                        abbreviated titles of books without chapter numbers. Chapter numbers are
                        usually in the margins in black or brown ink, written by the scribe rather
                        than rubricator. Psalms are written as prose with verses starting with 1-line
                        plain red initials. English psalm titles in red. Psalm numbers in the margins
                        in the original hand as Roman numerals. Larger initials with penwork at
                        psalms 26, 38, 52. 68, 80, 97, 109. Latin incipits of psalms are added in the
                        margins in a different later hand on fols. 233v–235r. Fol. 232v is blank.
                        </note><note type="corrections">Heavily corrected in several contemporary hands, both in the margins
                        and within the text. Corrections in the stint of the first scribe are particularly
                        frequent and are often over erasures. Parts of the text on fols. 1–26
                        have been retraced in a later hand. Many corrections throughout are
                        linguistic or stylistic, including the additions of the forms of the verbs
                        ‘have’ and ‘shall’, the definite article, demonstrative and personal pronouns
                        and other function words. Many corrections in the stint of the first scribe
                        are orthographic, including the additions of final -e and -n, or insertions
                        of punctuation.</note>

                  <provenance>Execution is highly variable, suggesting that it is a working copy; heavily
                     corrected, perhaps used in a workshop. There is no attempt to match hands,
                     the format of rubrics, running titles or chapter numbers. The last hand may
                     be the hand responsible for the Hereford inscription in MS Douce 369 (de
                     Hamel (2001), p. 172). The text may have been checked against MS Douce
                     369, or a version similar to it, and corrected to bring it in conformance with
                     this version. A break at the same point in the text occurs in MS Douce 369
                     and Cambridge University Library MS Ee. 1. 10.</provenance>
