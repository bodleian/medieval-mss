                        <note> Calendar of Christ Church, Canterbury (ed. by Wormald, 1939), laid
                           out one month per page, written in black, red, magenta and blue, graded
                           to 12 lessons, ‘in cappis’ and ‘in albis’. Includes Anselm (21 April) and
                           Thomas of Hereford, canonized 1320 (2 October). Anne (26 July, ‘In cappis
                           altis’) is added; David and Chad (1 and 2 March) are added and erased.
                           Titles ‘pape’ erased, but not the feasts of Thomas Becket or their
                           octaves. Verses on the ‘Egyptian’ days at the start of each month differ
                           from all sets published by Hennig (1955), but have the largest number of
                           similarities with his set VII. Notes on the number of hours in day and
                           night at the end of each month. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150 in the biblical order, laid out with each verse starting
                           on a new line, without titles. Numbers of some psalms are added in a
                           post-medieval hand. Punctuated throughout with punctus used to mark the
                           ends of verses, punctus elevatus used to mark metrum, and punctus or
                           punctus elevatus used to mark minor pauses. There are textual divisions
                           at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 101, 109 and 119 (see
                           ‘Decoration’). Subdivisions within psalms are marked with 2-line initials
                           at 17: 26 (fol. 22r), 77: 36 (fol. 89v), 103: 25 (fol. 121r), 104: 23
                           (fol. 123r), 105: 32 (fol. 126v), 106: 25 (fol. 129r) and 144: 10 (fol.
                           167v); rubric ‘division’ is added at 88: 20 (fol. 103r). Psalm 118 is
                           subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse units. </note>
