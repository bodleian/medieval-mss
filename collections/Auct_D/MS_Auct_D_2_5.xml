                        <note> Psalms 1–150, laid out as prose, without titles or numbers.
                           Punctuated throughout, with punctus elevatus used to mark metrum, punctus
                           or punctus elevatus occasionally used to mark minor pauses, and punctus
                           used to mark the ends of verses. Subdivisions within psalms are not
                           indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse
                           units. Psalms 148–150 (fols. 63v–64r), a sequence for all Lauds in
                           monastic and secular use, are written as a single text. There are textual
                           divisions at psalms 26, 38, 52, 68, 80, 97 and 109 (see ‘Decoration’).
