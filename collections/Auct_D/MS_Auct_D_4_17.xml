                     <summary>As argued by Nigel Morgan (cat. 131), the iconography is closely related to the Morgan Apocalypse (<ref target="https://www.themorgan.org/manuscript/110814">New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, MS. M. 524</ref>), and the two manuscripts 'depend on a common prototype'. (Other closely related manuscripts are the Paris Apocalypse, <ref target="https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc717440">BNF Français 403</ref>, c. 1250,  and <ref target="https://www.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk/view/MS-LATIN-00019/1">Manchester, John Rylands Library, Latin MS. 19</ref>, fourteenth century.) Stylistic differences suggest the Morgan and Bodleian manuscripts are not from the same workshop; Morgan associates the Bodleian manuscript with the York Psalter workshop (named after London, British Library, Addit. MS. 54179) which has not been localized. The association of the manuscript with St Albans, suggested in older literature, is no longer accepted. <ref target="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000468709">Pächt and Alexander</ref> (iii. 438, pl. XXXIX-XL) considered the miniatures to be the work of two or three hands, but Morgan identified one hand with 'some differences of quality'.</summary>
                     <decoNote type="miniature">Miniatures (coloured drawings) depicting the life and passion of St John the Evangelist (fols. 1r-2v, 22v-23v) and the Apocalypse. For the iconography see Morgan, op. cit., p. 201, and de Lisle and Meyer, op. cit., xii-lix.
