                        <note> Calendar (published and compared to the calendars of other psalters
                           from the Bruges–Ghent area by Carlvant, 1978, pp. 485–508), laid out one
                           month per page, written in red and black, approximately one-quarter full,
                           not graded. Includes saints venerated in Bruges: Walburga (1 May in red
                           and 4 August), Basil, patron of the chapel of St Basil and the Holy Blood
                           in Bruges (14 June) and the translation of Donatianus, patron saint of
                           Bruges (30 August). The feast of Donatianus (14 October) is omitted,
                           possibly as a result of confusion with Donatianus, martyr, entered on 24
                           May as ‘Donatiani archiepiscopi’ (Carlvant, 1978, p. 413). Other saints
                           include Amand (6 February), Egidius (1 September), Lambert, bishop of
                           Liège (17 September), Leodegar of Autun (2 October), Eligius (1 December)
                           and Medard (8 June). The calendar also includes Francis (4 October),
                           Catherine in red (25 November), Martin in red (11 November) and his
                           translation (4 July), Nicholas in red (6 December) and his translation (9
                           May) and Lawrence in red (10 August). There is a 14th-century addition at
                           22 October: ‘Hic Joras (?) [or ‘Ferat’ (?)] de Woseo (?)’. </note>

                           1), written with each verse starting on a new line, without titles or
                           numbers. The psalms are in the biblical order; subdivisions within psalms
                           are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into twenty-two
                           8-verse units. Punctuated throughout with punctus elevatus used to mark
                           metrum and minor pauses, and punctus used to mark the ends of verses.
                           There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 101 and

                        <note> Litany, including saints venerated in the Bruges–Ghent and Tournai
                           regions: Martin, Eligius, Bavo, Trudo, Benedict, Remigius, Amand, Vedast,

                           who was elected pope in January 1276 and died in June 1276. <list>

                        divisions. The initials depict saints (several of the same saints occur in
                        London, British Library, Burney MS. 345) on gold backgrounds, with full or
                        three-quarter borders made of gold, pink and blue bars, decorated with
                        grotesques, human heads, birds, coiled tendrils and foliage. The miniatures
                        are painted on single leaves and face historiated initials; those facing the

                     of the calendar and decoration), in a workshop responsible for the production
                     of other luxury psalters (Carlvant, 1985). MS. Auct. D. 4. 2 has many
                     similarities in codicology, illumination and textual contents with other
                     contemporary psalters from the Bruges– Ghent area, such as MS. Douce 38
                     (‘Tweede Groep’, Carlvant, 1978, pp. 140–57). The simplicity of its calendar
                     and textual contents and the lack of agreement between the litany and the
                     calendar suggest that it was made for a lay patron. </provenance>
