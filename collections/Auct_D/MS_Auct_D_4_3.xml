                           Becket is erased on 29 December. The months are headed by verses on the
                           ‘Egyptian’ days which correspond to Hennig’s (1955) set III. [items 2–5

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, written with each verse starting on a new line, without
                           titles. The leaf which originally contained the Beatus-initial is
                           missing, so that the first psalm begins ‘Qui non abiit ...’. The psalms
                           are in the biblical order; subdivisions within psalms are not indicated,
                           apart from psalm 118, subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse units.
                           Punctuated throughout with punctus elevatus used to mark metrum and minor
                           pauses, and punctus used to mark the ends of verses. There are textual
                           divisions at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 101 and 109 (see
                           ‘Decoration’). The numbers of psalms 1–50 are added in the margins in
                           Roman numerals and, beginning with psalm 38, in Arabic numerals, possibly
                           by the 15th-century owner Rose Tresham (see ‘Provenance’), who may have
                           also written ‘Beatus vir’ on fol. 7r. </note>

                              not in the Bruges–Ghent region during the 13th century (Carlvant,
                              1986, p. 93). Bruges–Ghent psalters with Davidic cycles have David

                  <provenance>The psalter has many similarities in the calendar, script,
                     codicological features and decoration with Oxford, Bodleian Library MS. Laud
                     Lat. 85 and may have been produced in the same workshop (Carlvant, 1978, pp.
                     93–5; and 1986). Both psalters were brought to England in the 14th century,
                     where litanies were replaced with new, largely identical standard Sarum texts.
                     According to Carlvant, MS. Laud Lat. 85 contains no clear indication of its
                     destination and its calendar entries are too sparse to allow conclusions (1978,
                     p. 93; 1986, p. 94). The calendar of MS. Auct. D. 4. 3 has saints venerated in
                     north-eastern France, but also in Bruges, such as Donatianus and Basil. This is
                     not unique, as MS. Douce 49, made for the use of the diocese of Thérouanne,
                     also has saints venerated in French Flanders, as well as Donatianus and Basil.
                     The calendar of MS. Douce 49, however, has more features associated with the
                     diocese of Thérouanne and the region of St-Omer, such as Audomar (9 September)
                     in red. The psalter may have been made for a lay patron: its textual contents
                     are simple and the calendar is not graded. </provenance>
