                        <note> Calendar of the second half of the 15th century for the use of the
                           convent of Lacock, written in blue, red and black, graded up to 9
                           lessons, laid out one month per page, approximately half full
                           (described by Smith, 1985). Includes the feasts of Augustine (‘patris
                           nostri’, deposition with octave (28 August and 4 September) and
                           translation (11 October)) and Bernard (20 August), all in red; the
                           duplex feast of Cyriac in red (8 August) and his commemoration (16
                           March). The convent of Lacock was situated in the parish of St Cyriac.
                           The dedication of the convent church is on 11 September, with octave;
                           the feast of the relics is on 14 July. The entries for Osmund
                           (deposition (4 December) and translation (16 July)) indicate that the
                           calendar postdates 1457. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150 in the biblical order, without numbers or titles,
                           written with each verse beginning on new line. Fols. 8r–174v were
                           written c. 1260; fols. 1r–7v and 175r–210r (from quire XVIII onwards)
                           after 1457. There are textual divisions at psalms 1, 26, 38, 51, 52,
                           68, 80, 97, 101 and 109. Subdivisions within psalms are not indicated,
                           apart from psalm 118, generally subdivided into 8-verse units, though
                           the beginnings of units starting with letter ‘I’ are not indicated
                           (‘I’ was omitted by the illuminator also at the beginning of some
                           psalms). Punctuated throughout with punctus used to mark the ends of
                           verses and punctus elevatus used to mark metrum; punctuation is
                           sometimes added to mark the minor pauses. </note>

                     <summary>A single quire (fols. 139–150) contains original 13th-century
                        decoration (including a historiated initial on fol. 148r) in the
                        tradition of the Oxford illuminator William de Brailes. The figure-style
                        is close to that of the first artist of the Salvin Hours (London, British
                        Library, Add. MS. 48985); other ornamental features derive from an Oxford
                        workshop which seems to have first established itself in the early years
                        of the decade 1250–60 (Morgan, 1982, p. 149). Further illumination,
                        including the main psalm initials on fols. 139–150, was added in the
                        second half of the 15th century. Ink sketches of the originally planned
                        13th-century decoration are preserved around some initials in this
                        section (e.g. a dragon-head, fol. 142r) (Morgan, 1982, p. 149).</summary>
