                        <support>parchment (with a few replacement leaves of paper)</support>
                        <collation>Bruce Barker-Benfield, 2018: <p>Collation difficult,
                              due to the manuscript’s repeated rebindings and repairs. These suggest
                              the following stages in its binding history: (1) a lost original
                              binding for the parchment leaves when first written in the 11th(?)
                              century, comprising regular quires of eight leaves each; (2) a major
                              repair, perhaps a second binding also now lost, to accommodate the
                              paper leaves inserted to replace lost parchment leaves (including one
                              whole quire and more), towards the end of the middle ages (14th or
                              15th century?); (3) the present binding of speckled brown leather with
                              simple blind-roll decoration over thick pasteboard, late 17th or
                              earlier 18th century, made for the Bodleian Library some decades after
                              the manuscript’s arrival at Oxford in 1629 (the blank paper flyleaves
                              at fols. ii and 207 most likely belong to this date); (4) further
                              heavy repairs and rebacking for the Bodleian, late 19th or 20th
                              century, providing new spine-leather, new paper endleaves (pastedowns
                              and fols. i and 208) and heavy repairs to the damaged edges of the
                              paper leaves at fols. 1-3.</p>
                           <p>The replacement paper leaves of the later middle ages are the present
                              fols. 1, 2, 3 and 17-24. However, whilst fols. 1, 3 and 17-24 are in
                              the correct position for their textual contents, the present fol. 2 is
                              misplaced: its text replaces that of the missing eighth parchment leaf
                              of the first quire (cut out between the present fols. 8 and 9).
                              Accordingly the present fol. 2 (paper) was misbound in its present
                              position. It was already misplaced there by the time when the
                              Bodleian’s ink foliation, perhaps 17th century, numbered it as ‘2’:
                              accordingly, it probably came loose between stages (2) and (3) and was
                              finally misbound at stage (3). This relatively early dating for fol.
                              2’s misplacement is further supported by a large matching
                              (pre-Bodleian) stain at the foot of each of fols. 1, 2 and 3.</p>
                           <p>The added fols. 17-24 seem to replace the original third quire of
                              eight leaves plus one further leaf (the missing first leaf of the
                              fourth quire, before fol. 25): so the eight paper leaves are replacing
                              nine original parchment leaves. Another parchment leaf later in the
                              fourth quire is also missing between fols. 29 and 30, leaving a lacuna
                              in the text for which there is no surviving paper replacement. The
                              17th-century ink foliation runs continuously from 29 to 30, to
                              indicate that the loss had already occurred by then.</p>

                                 (with conjoint stubs), not a bifolium, but this was an original
                                 discrepancy in the make-up of the quire at the time of writing,
