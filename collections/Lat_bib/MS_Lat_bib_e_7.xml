                     <note>Very unusually for an English Bible of the first half of the 13th century, the choice and sequence of books corresponds to those of the standard Paris Bible, except that I Esdras/III Ezra is omitted. Also very unusually, almost all prologues are omitted (even Ecclesiasticus 1:1–5, ‘Multorum nobis … vitam agere’, and Luke 1:1–4, ‘Quoniam quidem … vertitatem’, both often treated as prologues, are absent). There are very few rubrics, except for the tituli to the psalms, and Baruch 6 (alias the Prayer of Jeremiah, fol. 272r).</note>

                              <item>2. The illumination of these texts, by William de Brailes and, for the last few biblical books only, a colleague with whom de Brailes collaborated on at least one other manuscript (see above).</item>
                              <item> 3. The addition of the first quire (with two prologues) and the Missal texts, illuminated by a third artist. </item>
                              <item>4. The addition of two further masses in margins, including that for the 1233 translation and 1234 canonisation of St Dominic.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p><p>A feature of the production process of the volume is a series of plummet numbers in the lower margins adjacent to illuminated initials: when an illuminated initial occurs on a verso the number is below it, and when an initial occurs on a recto the number is on the facing age (i.e. the numbers are always on a verso). The numbers indicate how many leaves there are since the previous illuminated initial: thus the Genesis initial is on fol. 5r; the Exodus initial is 16 leaves later, on fol. 20r, and fol. 20v has ‘16’; the Leviticus initial is 14 leaves later, on fol. 34v, and has ‘14’; and so on; the next several numbers are ‘9’ (fol. 43v), ‘14’ (fol. 57v), ‘11’ (fol. 68v), ‘7’ (fol. 76v), ‘9’ (fol. 85v), and ‘1’ (fol. 86v).</p>
