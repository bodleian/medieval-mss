                     <title key="work_10451" type="desc">Old and New Testaments in the Later Version of the Wycliffite Bible</title>
                     <note>Old Testament books from Exodus to Ecclesiasticus and 1, 2 Maccabees are prefaced by their descriptions in the General Prologue; Isaiah and Baruch have their usual prologues. The openings of the sections on Tobit, Judith and Ecclesiasticus have been adjusted to remove doubts about canonicity (Dove, M., <title>The first English Bible: the text and context of the Wycliffite versions</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 96–7, 120, 262). At the start of Genesis: <q>Seke þou þe prolog of genesis at þe ende of machabeis þat is bitwixe þe olde lawe &amp; newe</q>
                        <locus>(fol. 1r)</locus>. Old Testament ends on fol. 279r with a rubric <q>þe olde testament endiþ here</q> and is followed by chapters 1–3 of the General Prologue, as far as the end of the description of Genesis. The chapters begin <q>Fyue and twenty bookis of þe oolde testament…</q> and end <q>…&amp; in alle þingis don his wille</q> (Dove, 2010, ll. 1–150). They are preceded by a rubric <q>Here bigynneþ a reule þat telliþ of þe bookis of þe oolde testament whiche ben of very feiþ &amp; whiche ben not of feiþ. But alle þe bookis of þe newe testament ben of feiþ &amp; of bileeue &amp; also here bigynneþ þe prolog of genesis in þe ende</q>.</note>
                     <finalRubric>Here endiþ þe prolog of genesis <locus>(fol. 279v)</locus></finalRubric>
                     <note>New Testament books have their usual the Later Version of the Wycliffite Bible prologues. Matthew has one prologue followed by a rubric <q>Ierom in his two prologis on matheu seiþ pleynly al þis</q>
                        <locus>(fol. 280r)</locus> (see Provenance). Lacks Job 9:18 to Psalms 17:38 because of the loss of a quire.</note>
                     <note>Running titles in red on both rectos and versos preceded by blue paraphs consisting of abbreviated titles of books only. Usual rubrics in red. Rubrics in red pointing out the differences between the Hebrew and Latin texts in Esther and Daniel. Chapter numbers as red Roman numerals. Added material within the text is underlined in red or faintly in black. Glosses in the margins. Indexing letters in the margins in New Testament only. Red and blue paraphs at the beginning of sections within the text. Corrections in the original or contemporary hands.</note>
                     <note>3-line blue initials with red penwork at the beginnings of psalms; 5-line initials and penwork borders at the beginning of psalms 26, 38, 52, 68, 80, 97 and 109. Psalms are laid out as prose with verses starting with 1-line alternating red or blue initials. Psalm titles in English in red. Latin incipits in red at the beginning of some psalms (mostly those at liturgical divisions) or added in the margins in a late 15th-century hand. Psalm 118 is subdivided into 22 sections with 2-line initials at the beginning of sections.</note>
                     <note>Many notes throughout in a late 15th-century hand in the margins citing or summarising the text.</note>
