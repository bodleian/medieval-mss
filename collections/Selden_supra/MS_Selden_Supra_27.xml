                        <foliation>i–iii, 1–94 in 20th-century pencil. There are vestiges of a 19th-century pencil foliation in the lower right corner, often more or less thoroughly erased, and sometimes discrepant (e.g. fols. 70–71 were previously 69–70) and an altered 20th-century foliation (e.g. fol. 57r has ‘60’, erased, immediately adjacent to it). Bannister’s notes state ‘NB. ff. 92 not 91 – 69 is double’ (fol. ir); where he refers to ‘f. 79’ this has been corrected in pencil to ‘80’ (fol. i verso), and his ‘90v’ is corrected to ‘91v’. </foliation>
                        <collation>The collation of fols. 1–7 is uncertain due to damage and later repair. Smoje suggested a bifolium followed by a quire of four leaves with an additional leaf inserted in the middle. At least one leaf is missing after fol. 2, and fol. 5 is a singleton. The simplest interpretation is that the first quire was regularly formed of 8 leaves, with the third leaf now missing, and it does appear that fols. 3–4 form the centre of a quire. 1(8–1) (fols. 1–7, 3 missing after fol. 2), 2–7(8) (fols. 8–55), 8(8–1) (5th leaf missing; fols. 56–62), 9(8) (fols. 63–70), [quire missing], 10(8) (fols. 71–78), [quire missing], 11(8) (fols. 79–86), 12(6) (the 3rd and 4th leaves are singletons; fols. 87–92) </collation>

                  <provenance>Hartmut Hoffmann (reported in <title>Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen Codices 484 &amp; 381</title>, ed. Wulf Arlt and Susan Rankin (1996) I.112) dated the manuscript 'at the latest the last quarter of the tenth century'. Smoje, p. 13 suggested the middle of the 11th century. Van Dijk, followed by Pächt and Alexander, earlier suggested the second half of the 11th century.</provenance>
                  <provenance>Apparently written for use in the diocese of Eichstätt, probably for <orgName key="org_139922418" role="fmo">St Wunibald's, Heidenheim</orgName>, as suggested by the importance accorded to Sts Willibald, Winibald, and Walburga: Willibald was first bishop of Eichstätt; his brother Winibald founded the double monastery at Heidenheim (about 50km to the south-west of Eichstätt, and within its diocese) and was its first abbot; their sister Walburga was first abbess. The two main parts seem to have been copied from different (St Gall?) models, but as the second starts in the same quire as that in which the firsts ends, they were demonstrably written as a single volume. Smoje suggests that it was owned by a succession of cantors of Heidenheim; additions were made in the 12th and 13th centuries.</provenance>
                  <provenance>Inscribed in German ‘do hutt ich un<ex>de</ex> gotefrit’, 13th(?) century (fol. 46v, upper margin). </provenance>

Seld. 27.’ in 17th-/18th-century ink and ‘[kept as Arch. F.e.10]’ in 20th-century pencil (fol. iir). To judge by the various foliations, some leaves have been rearranged at least once since acquisition by the Library.</acquisition>
