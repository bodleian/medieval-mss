                     <title key="work_5609">Anatomy of the Body of Man</title>
                     <note>Ed. Frederick J. and Percy Furnivall, EETS, extra ser. 53 (1888), 11–86/2, working from the 1577 edition (STC 24713). There is said to have been a 1548 edition (STC 11715.5), for which no witnesses survive, but its existence has been doubted by Duncan P. Thomas, ‘Thomas Vicary and the <title>Anatomie of Mans Body</title>’, <title>Medical History</title>, 50 (2006), 235–46 (see also id., ‘Thomas Vicary, barber-surgeon’, <title>Journal of Medical Biography</title>, 14 (2006), 84–89). The text presented here differs markedly from that recorded in the 1577 edition. The identification of Vicary as ‘sergeant of surgeons’ dates the incipit after 1530, when he was given the reversion of this royal office, and it may suggest a date after 1536 when he actually succeeded to the position. The <foreign>terminus post quem non</foreign> for composition and this transcription is presumably 1547, since Henry VIII is described with no suggestion he is now dead. </note>
                     <note> A leaf with the conclusion has been cut out, now replaced by a paper leaf (s. xix, in the foliation ‘44’), which provides the last five lines of the text from the 1577 edition, along with a few notes on the contents of the manuscript; it is all written in the script of F. J. Furnivall. </note>

In the contents table, most of the recipes are marked as ‘secundum M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buttes’, for whom see the various Sloane recipes, ed. EETS es 53:223–24, 227, where Sir William Butts (d. 1545) is identified as a royal surgeon. MS Sloane 1047 is a large fair-copy recipe book of c. 1550 (it includes one recipe for Anne of Cleves and thus cannot predate 1540). The recipes are presented in categories which roughly correspond to the types of medicines distinguished in Geene’s heading here.</note>

                  <provenance> Like many physicians, Geene wrote the book for his personal consultation: ‘This was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                     <persName key="person_2659" role="fmo">George Geene</persName> his booke Chirurgen of the Citie of London’ above an added medical recipe (fol. 1, s. xvi<hi rend="superscript">med.</hi>). If this was produced within the ambit of the Barber-Surgeons, later in the century it had moved into other hands in London: of the names mentioned in the added section only Mr Crow, if he is identifiable with <persName key="person_2661">William Crowe</persName> who was warden of the Company of Barber-Surgeons in 1579 (Young, <title>Annals</title>, 6]), was a significant figure in the Company; the Walter Bayley who is also mentioned was fellow of the College of Physicians from 1581.</provenance>
                  <provenance notAfter="1600" notBefore="1530"> There is another early signature, ‘<persName key="person_2542" role="sgn">Thomas Nicholas</persName>’ (fol. 2, upper margin, s. xvi); he is not one of the scribes of the volume and is not identifiable but it may be noted that he also wrote ‘Mary Nicholles’ at fol. 38.</provenance>
                  <provenance when="1891"> The manuscript’s subsequent descent is uncertain until the ownership inscription, ‘<persName key="person_71467450" role="fmo">F. J. Furnivall</persName> 15 May 1891’ (fol. 1), that is, the promoter of workers’ education (and rowing), and scholar of Middle English (1825–1910), who edited the text for EETS. Presumably Furnivall would have acquired the manuscript for information useful in the promised second volume of his edition (which never appeared). On him, see William Benzie, <title>Dr. F. J. Furnivall: A Victorian Scholar Adventurer</title> (Norman OK, 1983). Of his library, some of his papers and his personal book-collection were donated by his son, Percy, to the English Department of King’s College, London in 1910; he also owned some manuscripts: Lafayette College (Easton, PA) was given by Furnivall a sixteenth-century English manuscript translation of Bernard Trevisan in 1881 (Seymour de Ricci, <title>Census of medieval and Renaissance manuscrips in the United States and Canada</title>, 2 vols (New York, 1935 – 37), 2:2000), and he bequeathed to Harvard University a copy of Frère Laurent of Orléans’s <title>Somme le Roi</title> which is now Houghton Library, MS Fr. 123, ‘in memory of my dear old friend, Prof. F[rancis] James Child [1825–96]’; a digital facsimile of that manuscript is available on their website [last accessed 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> December 2015].</provenance>
                  <provenance notAfter="1913"> Also signed by ‘<persName key="person_79390571" role="fmo">John Munro</persName>’ (fol. 1), and with his letter of donation to Christ Church, dated 26 October 1913, and signed J. J. Munro (fol. ii); the gift is also recorded in the Library Report for that year, preserved in MS. 392. Munro (1883–1956) came up to Christ Church in 1913 but left for war service in the eastern Mediterranean; he returned and took degrees, his BA in 1920 and MA in 1921. He edited a collection of memoirs of <title>Frederick James Furnivall. A volume of personal record</title>(Oxford, 1911). He presumably held Furnivall in such admiration because of his own background as a ‘working man’ who became a mature student. He followed Furnivall’s enthusiasms by himself becoming Associate Editor to the Early English Text Society. His career divided between his wartime exploits and his employment in communications; after his retirement, he spent his time in Shakespeare studies (obituary in <title>The Times</title>, 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> October 1956, p. 11).</provenance>
