                     <note>Ed. J. B. Hall (Stuttgart, 1995), with this manuscript listed as O8 in the codicum catalogus. The books divide at fol. 19, 33, 52, 68. There is a considerable amount of glossing, diminishing throughout the volume, in a very small version of the text hand. Most of this indicates grammatical relationships, but, e.g., a sequence of five citations from Tibullus appear as a marginal gloss on fol. 30. Fol. 86<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> has only four lines and the colophon, which is presented cul-de-lampe. </note>

                  <provenance> There is continuous evidence of ownership from the early nineteenth century. At fol. i<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, ‘Celotti’ ‘159’; his sale, 14 March 1825, lot 217. On the book-collector and art dealer, <persName key="person_101092513" role="fmo">Luigi Celotti</persName>, see now Anne-Marie Eze, Abbé Luigi Celotti: Connoissuer, Dealer, and Collector of Illuminated Miniatures (unpublished doctoral thesis, Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, 2010). <persName key="person_73979081" role="fmo">Sir Thomas Phillipps</persName> bought extensively at the sale: A. N. L. Munby, <title>The Formation of the Phillipps Library up to the year 1840</title>, Phillipps Studies, 3 (Cambridge, 1954), 50–51 &amp; 147, including this manuscript, with his nos 960 and 2767 (in ink, fol. i<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>; the stamped ex-libris, fol. ii). It was put up for sale at Sotheby’s in the eight part of the Phillipps collection, on 10 June 1896 as lot 941, but did not sell (Schoenberg 40265) and returned to their rooms for the tenth part, 6 June 1898, lot 887 (Schoenberg 60033; a note from the sale catalogue, pasted to our fol. i<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>); it was purchased by J. and J. Leighton, booksellers, for 1 guinea. They sold it to <persName key="person_66754839" role="fmo">Charles Butler (1822–1910)</persName> and it later made a return visit to Sotheby’s for sale, along with other manuscripts which had been owned by Butler, on 19 July 1921, as lot 489 (Schoenberg 48856); a pencil note in the Bodleian copy suggests it sold for £28 (which would be a remarkably high price). Presumably, from there, it reached Dobell’s: their catalogue 48 (1925), no. 14 offered for 10 guineas (the page pasted to our fol. i), whence purchased by <persName key="person_83056404" role="fmo">S. G. Owen</persName>, the editor of (1889, 1894, 1915) and commentator on (1893, 1902, 1924) the <title>Tristia</title>. He bequeathed the book to ChCh, as he did the previous manuscript.</provenance>
