                     <handNote>S. G. Owen, the early twentieth-century owner of the manuscript (see provenance), sought the advice of the palaeographer E. A. Lowe about its origins; the latter’s letter in response, dated 9 December 1929, is kept at the front of the volume; in it, he suggests ‘the curious errors of spelling make one think of the province of Venice. It is quite likely it was written in the Veneto, and then migrated to the province of Lombardia’. The supposition of a Veneto origin was repeated by Owen himself in print (‘A Manuscript of Ovid’s Heroides’, <title>Classical Quarterly</title>, 30 (1936), 155–69 and 31 (1937), 1–15, with discussion at very first page). The provenance of the illumination, however, may equally suggest that the manuscript was manufactured in Milan, with the scribe either being from the Veneto or working from a prototype from that area.</handNote>

Tilly de la Mare informed Ker (608 n1) that the decoration is Milanese. At the opening of each epistle, two-line red lombards. Capitals at the opening of each line set off in a separate column. AT no. 994 (103), identifies the initial as Milanese but suggests it was added, s. xv<hi rend="superscript">2/4</hi>, a date which is surely too late.</decoNote>

                  <provenance> There is on the former pastedowns an extensive series of inscriptions indicating use of the manuscript as a school text in northern Lombardy in the fifteenth century: (a) ‘Iste liber ouidi est nostrorum videlicet petri Antonii filiorum domini Iohannis de Nailate pergentium ad scolas Bertrami da Lucino qui est bonus doctor in sua grammatica’ (fol. ii<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, s. xv; Piero signs again several times on the same folio); (b) ‘Iste ouidius est mei francisi Iohannis et donati filiorum antonii de naylate qui pergunt ad scolas domini magistri georgij de erba qui est bonus doctor in sua gramatica et in ?allis scie<del>nciis</del>’ (fol. 51); (c) ‘Ego simon de n<gap quantity="5" reason="deleted" unit="char"/> de superiori sum bonus <gap quantity="3" reason="deleted" unit="char"/> xvj. menssis februarij Mcccclvj.’ (fol. ii<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>); (d) ‘Iste liber est mei franci<add place="margin">s</add>cus <sic/> de remondis qui pergit at scolas domini magistri <del>teo</del>dori de lucino qui est bonus doctor . . .’ (several times, in one form or another, on fol. 50, ? s. xv); this last probably the annotator the volume, adding the titles to each epistle and regularly marking ‘nota’ in the margin, as well was making rhetorical figures at fol. 38 (Anostropha | Repetitio vel anaphora ...). The loconyms of the teachers (Lucino, Erba) suggest the presence of the manuscript in or around Como. Ker (608 n2) notes the existence of a Theodore Lucinus Comensis, who wrote a grammar, <title>Moralium dictorum isagogicus libellus</title> ([Ferrara: Andreas Belfortis, c. 1493]; ISTC, no. il00332800); he taught in Como and has been tentatively identified as the first schoolmaster of Paolo Giovio: see T. C. Price Zimmermann, <title>Paolo Giovio: the historian and the crisis of sixteenth-century Italy</title>(Princeton, NJ, 1995), 6.</provenance>
                  <provenance> The manuscript was still in Italy in the eighteenth-century when a reader, in the <foreign>volgare</foreign>, notes a textual irregularity (fol. 33). It moved – perhaps in the Napoleonic period – to France in the mid-nineteenth century: it was sold as the property of the Cambrai printer <persName key="person_221801978" role="fmo">Armand-François Hurez</persName> on 12 February 1856, as lot 13 (Schoenberg 76097). It appeared again at sale in Paris six years later (Schoenberg 93472) but then crossed the Channel, being auctioned in Sotheby’s rooms on 29 June 1865 (Schoenberg 65020), as lot 64. It was subsequently sold by Sotheby’s as lot 1629 in the sale of <persName key="person_316003889" role="fmo">Henry White</persName>’s books which began on 21 April 1902 (Schoenberg 9082); according to the marked-up copy in the Bodleian, it was sold for £4 18s to Slatter and Rose. It was presumably from that Oxford bookseller that it was purchased by <persName key="person_83056404" role="fmo">S[idney] G[eorge] Owen</persName> (‘Manuscript of <title>Heroides</title>’ (1936), 155), who bequeathed it to ChCh. Owen, born in 1858, matriculated at Balliol in 1877; he received his BA in 1882 (with two prizes) and his MA in 1886. He was elected Student and Tutor in Classics at Christ Church in 1891 and served until his retirement in 1927. He was an important editor of poetic texts, of Catullus (1893), of Juvenal (whom he also translated, 1902), and of Ovid’s <title>Tristia</title> (1915; see the next MS). He died in 1940 aged 81.</provenance>
