                  <provenance> It is not possible to reconstruct the early history of this volume. There is a name cancelled at fol. iv, and two erased ownership inscriptions at fol. 189<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (following the explicit). From the seventeenth century, there is a name ‘<persName key="person_2603" role="sgn">John Rakeby</persName>[?]’ at fol. vi. The first fully identifiable owner writes his name at fol. v: ‘Æ Lanc<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> lee his Booke 1671 | <persName key="person_2604" role="fmo">Eldred lancelott lee</persName>’. He has also signed on fol. 190, above an erased ownership inscription; and on fol. 191. On fol. 190, he follows his name with ‘qui ego hoc petiuit tam pro regni quam pro seipso sequitur ver<gap quantity="3" unit="char"/> et desendit <gap/>‘, the remainder abraded away. In addition, at fol. 189<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, he writes ‘Rogerus hope vnus clericorum francisci wythini in officio placitorum’, and ‘Iohannes Yonge seruiens <gap/>[the rest overwritten with flourishes]’ (the latter’s name also at fol. 190<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>). Eldred Lancelot Lee (Eldred presumably after the eleventh-century bishop of Worcester in whose diocese the Lee family’s ancestral home of Coton Hall, Shropshire, sat) is a known legal clerk from the reign of Charles II: J. S. Cockburn, ‘Seventeenth-Century Clerks of Assize – Some Anonymous Members of the Legal Profession’, <title>The American Journal of Legal History</title>, 13 (1969), 315–332 (328). The notes mentioning Hope and Yonge appear to be intended as aide-memoires concerning legal staff; that concerning Hope mentions the Tory judge Sir Francis Wythens (on whom see Eveline Cruickshanks in B. D. Henning, <title>The History of Parliament: the House of Commons, 1660–1690</title>(Cambridge, 1983), 3 vols, 3:783–84 and Stuart Handley in <title>Oxford DNB</title>). In 1686, Wythens and Eldred Lancelot Lee sat together on the Maidstone Assize: J. S. Cockburn, <title>Calendar of Assize Records: Kent Indictments, Charles II, 1676–88</title>(Woodbridge, 1997), 243 (no. 1261). It is reasonable to imagine that Lee carried this pocket-sized <foreign>registrum brevium</foreign> with him.</provenance>
                  <provenance> The earliest indication of ChCh ownership is the note: ‘The Dean at the request of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheeler one of the Chaplains of Christ Church deposited this Book in the Library June 20 1822’ (fol. ix). The Dean in question was <persName key="person_78639115">Charles H. Hall</persName>; he matriculated at Christ Church in 1779, and received four degrees: his BA in 1783, MA in 1786, BD in 1794, and DD in 1800. He was a canon of Christ Church from 1799, the Regius Professor of Divinity 1807–9, and Dean from 1809 until 1824, when he moved to the deanery of Durham; he died in 1827 aged 70 (<title>AOmod</title>, 587; J. F. A. Mason in <title>Oxford DNB</title>). Charles Wheeler was chaplain of Christ Church 1820–31 and died in 1835, aged 38 (<title>AOmod</title>, 1534). The volume includes the old ChCh shelfmark ‘Arch Sup C.25’ (pencil, fol. iv<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>), suggesting that this was added to the end of the C section which, in the New Library Catalogue, ended at 24 (see Appendix IV).</provenance>
