                    writes ‘Kyngesham’ (the rear pastedown); and the erased ‘Thomas Carpender’,
                    above a motto ‘Nil plus valet ad ponendum laborem’ (fol. i); he also signed
                    between epistles: his name is still visible at fol. 78<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> and in the initial at fol. 134<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>; further

                    pastedown with his note of possession, Carpender may have come by this volume
                    after that date, but, if so, he could not have enjoyed it for long. By the end
                    of 1565 he was dead, for the following year his executors established a

                    these may postdate the book’s donation to ChCh: ‘Liber ecclesiae Christi Oxon ex
                    dono <persName role="fmo" key="person_2031480">Johannis Howsoni</persName> Anno 1588<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>’ (fol. i<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>); the inscription is in the donor’s hand (cf. the
                    inscription in, for example, the printed book B.1.1). Howson was born in London,
                    and was at Christ Church in 1577. He received the degrees of BA in 1578 and MA
                    in 1581/2 (incorporated at Cambridge, 1583). He was licensed to preach in 1597,
                    a canon of Christ Church in 1601, BD and DD in 1601, vice-chancellor in 1602,
                    prebendary of Hereford from 1587 and of Exeter from 1592, and vicar of several
                    Oxfordshire parishes; in 1610, he was one of the first fellows of Matthew
                    Sutcliffe’s short-lived King James’s College, Chelsea. Further promotion came in
                    1618, when he was named as bishop of Oxford, a see he held until 4 July 1628,
                    when he was translated to Durham. He held that bishopric until his death on 6
                    February 1632 (<title>AO</title>, 757; Nicholas W. S. Cranfield
                    in <title>Oxford DNB</title>). As vice-chancellor,
                    Howson’s anti-puritan views involved him in sectarian controversy (<title>HUO</title>, 422). In addition to this codex, over his career, he
                    donated a few printed books to ChCh: on 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> January
                    1587, Paolo Giovio, <title>Vitae duodecim Vicecomitum Mediolani

                    ‘Provision of Books’, nos 1587.1 and 1602.1 (508, 511), and the last (the only
                    one in which he does not write an inscription) is entered in the Library Donors’
                    Book (p. 22<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>). The second and third of these printed
                    volumes have manuscript pastedowns. He also assisted the Library on at least one
                    other occasion: in the Disbursement Book for Hilary 1591, he signs for a payment
                    of 18d ‘to the carryer for bringinge the B[ishop] of Welles his booke’ (on this,
                    see Introduction). </provenance>
