                     <note>A partial copy of the Psalms with musical settings by <persName key="person_51820137" role="aut">Thomas Sternhold</persName> (d. 1549), <persName key="person_41827498" role="aut">John Hopkins</persName> (d. 1570) and others, for which the scribe appears to have had before him both the printing attributed to John Day of 1560 [STC 2427] and the edition entitled <title>The Whole Booke of Psalmes</title> printed by John Day in 1562 [STC 2430], from which it takes its ‘Short Introduction to the science of musick’ (fol. 413<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>-17). In its notation, it follows the 1562 edition but it largely follows the 1560 edition in its original selection of the Psalms to include. This is complicated by the fact that, at another sitting, the scribe returned and inserted further sections, taken from an edition of <title>The Whole Booke</title> no earlier that 1578 [STC 2450]: fol. 444<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>-447, providing Psalms 35 and 36 (with fol. 447<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> and fol. 448<hi rend="superscript">r-v</hi> blank) and fol. 451–454<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, providing Psalms 38–40 (with bottom two-thirds of fol. 454<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> blank). Thus, the complete series (with ‘n’ marking presence of notation and ‘+’ marking addition): 1n, 2, 3n, 4–13, 14n, 15–17, 18n, 19–20, 21n, 22–24, 25n, 26–29, 30n, 31–34, +35–36, 37, +38–40, 41n, 42–43, 44n, 49, 50n, 51n, 52n, 63–67, 68n, 69n, 70–71, 72n, 73–75, 78n, 79, 82, 100n, 103n, 114, 115n, 119n, 120n, 121n, 123, 124n, 125, 127–129, 130n, 133, 137n, 146, 148n, 149. </note>

                        <layout writtenLines="33 56">The mise-en-page alters between items, with the consistent features of the text being formed of long lines which are not ruled, always placed within a ruled border. As a result of these factors, the number of lines varies, sometimes substantially within an item. In the first main text, item 2, the written space is 121/24 × 65mm, marked by a set of binding lines extending to the edges of the pages and supplemented by an outer border, creating margins of 13/16mm, and there are 37–38 lines. In the next main text, item 4, the text-block is marked by binding lines forming a rectangle but the size changes: in the opening sections (up to fol. 103), it is 121/23 × 73mm, providing 44 lines; after that point, it is 113 × 53mm and 33 lines. This last layout continues in item 5. For items 6 and 8, the text-block is marked by a red rectangle measuring 119 × 73mm, with an extra binding line added within the rectangle 3mm from the left to create a column in which to place stanza numbers; there are 48–49 lines to a page. Item 7 and 9 are distinguished from items 4 and 6 by the rectangle and extra binding line being in the gray-black ink used for the text; the rectangle is c. 123 × 69mm, and the number of lines varies between 46 and 56. Item 10 has its rectangle in red, measuring 123 × 82mm, with one extra binding line, placed within the rectangle 20mm from the right to allow annotations; there are 40 lines.</layout>

                     <decoNote> The mise-en-page, setting the text within a rectangle, has been described above. In addition, there are running headers in all items. The scribe also adds, as well as the opening title-page (item 1), some initials, mainly concentrated in items 2 and 4. The preface to item 2 opens at fol. 2 with a 10-line initial, including a grotesque, in red, yellow and blue. Through this item and the next, there are two types of initials, the first providing foliage around letter, imitating printed initials; they occur at fol. 3 (9 lines), 8<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (8 lines), 83 (9 lines, in red, with short border), 96 (10 lines), 117 (4 lines, with gold and red, and short border), 118 (4 lines, gold, with red used for half-border), 118<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (likewise, with border including Tudor rose), 119 (likewise, but 5 lines), 119<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (5 lines, letter in black and gold), 120<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (5 lines), 122<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (likewise), 260<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (9 lines), 276<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (likewise), 277 (8 lines). The other style involves grisaille historiated initials, occurring at fol. 95 (10 lines, <hi rend="italic">all’antica</hi> vase and foliage), 99<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (grapes and acorn), 101 (with red outlining), 119<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (5 lines, turkey with red throat, a notably early depiction, given that William Strickland’s grant of arms including the bird he had imported from the New World occurred in 1550), 120 (5 lines, acorn, with nut in red and letter in gold), 123 (5 lines, artichoke), 124 (4 lines, fruit and flower) 125<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (6 lines, grotesque), 133 (8 lines), 134<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (6 lines, Tudor rose and pomengrate in the compartments of ‘B’, on the stem the letters ‘RO’ and ‘RT’), 136<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (5 lines, bird, branch and fruit), 137 (6 lines, knotted letter ‘A’). Item 5 opens, at fol. 311, with an initial of 9 lines in which the letter grows leaves, with sections painted in blue and gold, and grisaille. In item 6, there is also an historiated initial, at fol. 417, the letter ‘T’ formed by a bird and cornucopia with a roll reading ‘cantate domino nouum’ (Psalm 98); the initial is the height of two staves, which, in this item and item 10, have black notation on red lines. In addition, in this item and item 8, the first letter of each Psalm is rubricated, as is the name of the composer. In item 9, the notation is written on black lines.</decoNote>

                  <provenance> The scribe gives his surname as Tyas at fol. 1, and, at fol. 134<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, provides, in the initial, clues to his Christian name being Robert. In addition, at fol. 114<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, he draws a manicula pointing to 14 December and, in outer margin, a drawing of two hands joined with, above, the date ‘1573’. From these snippets of information, it is possible to identify him as the Robert Tyas who married Millisent Browne in 1573: <title>London Marriage Licences 1521–1869</title>, ed. Joseph Foster (London, 1887), col. 1372, licence provided on 8 December. He was a servant to the Royal Wardrobe, eventually being its Clerk in the 1590s and first years of the seventeenth century: <title>CSP Elizabeth</title>, 24:96 (505); <title>CSP James I</title>, 3:88 and 93 (42 and 55). It is perhaps Robert himself (since the script is of the late sixteenth century) who adds in secretary script a note at the top of fol. 579: ‘A quiet life who list to lead | let him vouchsafe these lines to read | &amp; redding print them in his mind | a quiet life then shall he find’. </provenance>
                  <provenance>It would appear that the volume descended within the family, since it was another Tyas who gave it to Christ Church. It is recorded in the Donors’ Register (MS LR 1), under the year 1675, at p. 174a: <p>Ornatissimus Vir Thomas Tyas Art. Mag<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> hujus Ecclesiae Alumnus</p>

                  </provenance>
                  <provenance>Born in Middlesex 1610 or 1611, <persName key="person_2639" role="fmo">Thomas Tyas</persName> or Tias, went up to Christ Church 24 February 1631/2 and received his BA 20 October 1632 and MA 4 June 1635; he was ordained deacon on 22 December 1639 (<title>AO</title>; CCED). His later career is not fully clear but he was still in residence at ChCh in 1648 when he crossed with the Parliamentarian Visitors (<title>The Register of the Visitors of the University of Oxford from A.D. 1647 to A.D. 1658</title>, ed. Montagu Burrows, Camden Society (London, 1881), 30 and 130). </provenance>
                  <provenance>The one complicating factor is the presence of the letters ‘<persName key="person_2640" role="fmo">MS</persName>’ on both boards of the binding. Though these might simply signify this is a manuscript, it would be more customary for them to stand for a person’s initials. If so, there is one relative of Thomas Tyas for whom they would be appropriate: the scribe, Robert, had a daughter who was christened Margaret and who in 1600 married Thomas (b. 1568; fl. 1634), one of the sons of Edwin Sandys, archbishop of York (E. S. Sandys, <title>History of the family of Sandys</title>, 2 vols (Barrow-in-Furness, 1930), 2: pedigree C). Her married initials were thus ‘MS’ and so perhaps she inherited this volume and it was bound for her. If so, it was patently returned later to the family of her birth.</provenance>
                  <provenance>This manuscript arrived just in time to appear in the 1676 catalogue (Appendix I, <hi rend="bold">[15]</hi>) but the shelfmark recorded there does not appear in the book itself. The only shelfmark at the inside of its upper board is written by Edward Smallwell and is the New Library ‘G.13’. </provenance>
                  <provenance>Within the manuscript is kept evidence of later interest in the volume: a two-page typed letter from the hymnologist and Vicar of Deddington, Maurice Frost (1888–1961), dated 16 February 1940, is stuck to fol. i<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, while a typescript description of items 6 to 10 (undated) by the English scholar, W[illiam A.] Ringler (1912–87) is kept loose with it; there is also a twentieth-century pencil note by ‘TYP’ at fol. 587. All those concentrate their attention on the metrical Psalms with notation; their comments are summarised in the on-line ChCh Music Catalogue. </provenance>
