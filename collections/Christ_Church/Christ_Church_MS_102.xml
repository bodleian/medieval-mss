                     <title key="work_14289" type="desc">Register of writs</title>
                     <note>For examples and discussion of such collections and their difficulties, see Elsa de Haas and G. D. G. Hall, <title>Early Registers of Writs</title>, Selden Society 87 (1970); and the exemplary calendar of a fully developed register, taken from Oxford: St John’s College, MS 256, W. S. Holdsworth, <title>A History of English Law</title>, 3rd ed., 9 vols (London, 1923–26), 2:618–36. For other examples of this genre, see our MSS 103 (item 19) and 123 below; those two, but not this manuscript, appear in the list of manuscripts at de Haas and Hall, xxiii-vii. A substantial number of stubs (at least nine) precede the incipit, which occurs on the leaf signed ‘C iiij’; the running title here identifies the writ as ‘Quare impedit’. The text breaks off in a section with running title ‘de manucapcione’.</note>
                     <note> Owing to missing leaves, the MS lacks materials from the sections ‘De decepcione’ (after fol. 60), ‘De secca ad molendum’ (after fol. 84), ‘De noua dessenia’ (after fol. 124), ‘De posteissenia’ (after fol. 130), ‘De recordo et processu mittendo’ (after fols 130, 131, and 135), ‘Dattincta mortis antecessoris’ and ‘de ingressu’ (after fol. 141). </note>
                     <note> The person who added the folio numbers also at times adds some annotations cross-referencing briefs with statutes (fol. 100<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> 103, 105<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> – 106,109<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>-110, 112<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>-113). The care taken to provide that foliation suggests the volume originally ended with an index (cf our MS 103). Comparison of what we have with Holdsworth’s listing of the contents of Oxford: St Johns, MS 256 (as cited above) hints at the amount lost at the beginning – the first five ‘capitula’ – and the end – two further capitula. The opening may have been preceded by further ancillary material: the few letters of text visible on the recto of the very first stub are in English, while the verso is blank, suggesting that the <title>Registrum</title> was preceded by another short text. </note>

                        <extent>Fols: ii + nine fragmentary leaves, three of them with some text but six mere stubs + 179 (numbered to 178, but an unnumbered leaf follows fol. 98) + ii (numbered fols 179–180). In addition to losses at both ends, a great many leaves have been torn away or are otherwise fragmentary: fols 33, 98, the lower halves of fols 139–41 and 149, and much of the leading edge of fol. 178; 131 is badly cut and much of the leading edge gone, but the text is still intact. <dimensions type="leaf" unit="mm">

                  <provenance> There is no definite internal evidence to indicate this volume’s early history. The text, as mentioned, is provided with several blank spaces but there are only three additions, all placed in the bottom margin and not providing any clear suggestion of a geographical origin: fol. 4<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (Westminster), 49<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (no place stated), 109<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (to an unidentified Earl of Warwick); the first two of these are in the scribal hand, and the third may also be, though it is in a more cursive version. The only later added material is a single note: ‘And for al that indeed the feare of his d|dreame being laid aside he cals unto him’ (the blank fol. 82<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, s. xvi<hi rend="superscript">2/4</hi>).</provenance>
                  <provenance> The manuscript can be equated with the entry in <persName key="person_9856931" role="fmo">Wake</persName>’s ‘Schedule’ of manuscripts (MS 352/8): ‘Registrum Brevium &amp;c. Imperfect’. That provenance is corroborated by the bookplate, and explains the manuscript’s absence from the New Library Catalogue (see Appendix IV). </provenance>
