                  <provenance> It is difficult to ascertain whether the Formulary actually provides information useful for determining provenance, especially in a context which includes (fol. 124<hi rend="superscript">rv</hi>) what looks like the jocular ‘John Doe’ name ‘Ratte Cappe’, who appears in a series of deeds with ‘Watte Stile’, first introduced as ‘Cetisin et orfeure de londrez’. Cf. H. E. Salter’s comments, <title>Snappe’s Formulary and Other Records</title>, OHS 80 (1924), 3.</provenance>
                  <provenance> However, a substantial number of documents included here suggest an <placeName key="place_7011931">Oxford</placeName> provenance and the copying of records from just after 1400. Fol. ii, in particular, includes a number of deeds from a monastic house, in some cases specifically <orgName key="org_155836576">Oseney</orgName>; on fol. ii<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> the reference is more specific, ‘frere Iohan Abbe del monst’ Doseney’, of three recorded fourteenth- and fifteenth-century figures with this name most likely John Bokeland, abbot 1373–1404. Fol. iii<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> is an anonymised deed involving ‘N abbas Mon’ Oseneye’ and lands in St. Peter’s parish, Oxford (near New College and St. Edmund Hall). Fol. iv<hi rend="superscript">rv</hi> includes a sequence of Oxford student begging letters and more general appeals for support; one refers to a friend ‘Iohan Doun’, another mentions ‘Thomas Compton’’, and a third includes ‘mon senur le Counte de Warwyke’. This last may be connected with the fragmentary incipit (fol. i), defaced from having been once pasted down, ‘¦¦et de notre cosyn Richard comite Warr’’, followed by an illegible reference to a dated parliament; this can only refer to Richard Beauchamp, earl 1401–39. His wife Elizabeth certainly had some connection to Oseney c. 1410; see MS 151 below. Several deeds on fol. 124<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> record promises to make payments in Oxford. Fol. v includes a faded addition mentioning <placeName key="place_7450215">Eastleach</placeName> (Glos.).</provenance>
                  <provenance> But other items are more dispersed. As already implied, there are a number of <placeName key="place_7011781">London</placeName> deeds, e.g. one regarding a tenement in ‘lumbardistrete’, one of the parties a ‘Ciuis et mercator london’’ (fol. iii). And there is a smattering of West Country materials, perhaps important in terms of subsequent ownership: fol. iv includes a complaint from the king’s vills of Weymouth and Melcombe (Dorset), and an indenture added at the foot of fol. v<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> involves William Payn, rector of the church of ‘Clouely’ (Clovelly, N Devon; Payn was incumbent from 1362 until his death in 1396) and John Stanton (the family of that surname held the manor of Clovelly from the fourteenth century; see Harry Clement, <title>Clovelly Church and its people</title>(Braunton, 1992), 13).</provenance>
                  <provenance> MLGB3 assigns the book, as well as our MS 91, to <orgName key="org_55" role="fmo">Crediton (Devon), the collegiate church of the Holy Cross</orgName>. This is on the basis of two erased inscriptions which, in 1947, Neil Ker read under ultraviolet. The first is at the top of fol. v<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (the last front flyleaf, with the formulary), he deciphered as ‘decano Crediton’; annotations through the manuscript are in the hand of <persName key="person_2618" role="fmo">John Lyndon</persName>, dean of the collegiate church of Crediton in the mid-fifteenth century (on whom, see MS. 91, <hi rend="smallcaps">provenance</hi>). The second inscription, on fol. 1 (the upper margin), Ker read as ‘Guilihelmi Muggi liber ex dono Magistri Georgii Mason’. See further A. P. D., ‘Mugge-Mason MSS’, <title>Bodleian Library Record</title>, 2 (1944), 91–92, for the descent of Crediton books from <persName key="person_2619" role="fmo">George Mason</persName>, the last Dean of the church, to <persName key="person_2620" role="fmo">William Mugge</persName>, presumably a relative of Walter Mugge, a canon of Crediton who took the Oath of Supremacy in 1534, as well as further comments on their descent to William Ballow. Ballow, an Oxfordshire man, first attended St John’s College, according to the donation note in the Bible he gave to that college in 1598, now their MS 48 (Ralph Hanna, <title>A Descriptive Catalogue of the Western Medieval Manuscripts of St John’s College Oxford</title>(Oxford, 2002), 66–67; Andrew Hegarty, <title>A Biographical Register of St John’s College, Oxford, 1555 – 1660</title>, OHS, ns 43 (Woodbridge, 2011), 189–90). He migrated to Christ Church, matriculating in 1587/8 and received his BA and MA in 1591 and 1594, respectively. He was a proctor in 1604, a BD and DD in 1605 and 1613, respectively, and was licensed to preach in 1606. He was in the service of the Lord High Chamberlain in 1605, rector of Milton Bryant (Beds.) from 1604, a canon of St. Paul’s from 1611. He was again at Christ Church as a canon from 1615–18, when he died, aged about 45 (<title>AO</title>, 64). He was buried in Oxford’s cathedral (John Le Neve, <title>Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae</title>, 3 vols (Oxford, 1854), 2:518). </provenance>
                  <provenance> It was <persName key="person_2617" role="fmo">William Ballow</persName> who gave this manuscript to ChCh; it is presumably his hand that wrote in the lower margin of fol. 1: ‘Hunc codicem manuscriptum Ædi Christi in gratiam studiosorum ibidem Guilielmus Ballowe [over erasure: in artibus magister] testificandi amoris sui ergo dono dedit 5º. Octobris an: Domini 1601’. As well as this manuscript, he donated at the same time our MS 91, and he later gave to ChCh 40s for book purchases, recorded in the Donors’ Register, MS LR 1, p. 27<hi rend="superscript">ab</hi>, under 1614. In addition, he was an early donor to the Bodleian Library, giving fifteen manuscripts in 1604, the year he was Proctor, and five the following year; of these, five were Crediton books (R. W. Hunt, <title>A Summary Catalogue of the Western Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library at Oxford</title> 1 (Oxford, 1953), 89 (nos 392–405) and 91 (nos 466–69)). For Ballow’s son, Thomas, as a donor to Christ Church, see our MS. 146.</provenance>
                  <provenance> This book bears the New Library shelfmark ‘F.1’ (fol. 1, lower margin). There is no sign of it having had an earlier shelfmark and, indeed, it is absent from the 1676 catalogue, though it does appear in the Old Archives catalogue as B.16 (see Appendix II).</provenance>
