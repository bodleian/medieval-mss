In our manuscript, the title announces the work (all in capitals) to be ‘Les Livre des Pseavmes escrites en diverses sortes de lettres par Esther Anglois Francoise’.

                     <handNote>The manuscript announces itself, in its prefatory material, to be the work of <persName key="person_95809102" role="scr">Esther Inglis</persName>; she was the daughter of Huguenot émigrés and herself a prolific professional copyist (1571–1624), and is depicted at fol. viii. The fullest discussion of her oeuvre is provided by A. H. Scott-Elliot and Elspeth Yeo, ‘Calligraphic Manuscripts of Esther Inglis (1571–1624): A Catalogue’, <title>Papers of the Bibiographical Society of America</title>, 84 (1990), 11–86, who list 55 products of her pen, with ours as no. 7; that list is now supplemented by Nicholas Barker’s introduction to the Roxburghe Club facsimile of Stokenchurch: Wormsley Library, MS RH158, entitled <title>Esther Inglis’s Les Proverbes de Salomon</title> ([London], 2012); Barker adds six items to her oeuvre. Information about Inglis can also be found on the on-line Perdita Manuscripts project [accessed 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> May 2014]. Like many of her manuscripts, our codex is a calligraphic tour-de-force, in which she demonstrates her mastery of an impressive range of scripts.</handNote>
                  </handDesc>
                  <decoDesc>
                     <decoNote> Essential to the attractiveness of this manuscript is its calligraphy, with Esther Inglis demonstrating her ability both to construct a script which appears as constant as anything print can offer and to move from one script to another. The progress of scripts is designed so that the openings usually alternate between one which is devoted to a single script, followed by another which displays a change. There are about seventeen different scripts present in this volume, in two to four different sizes. The fullest classification of her scripts is that provided by Nicolas Barker in the Roxburghe Club facsimile of Wormsley Library, MS RH158; he identifies her primary prototype to be Pierre Hamon’s pattern-book, <title>L’Alphabet de l’invention des lettres en diverses escritures</title> (Paris, 1561), and arranges her scripts mainly by his nomenclature. That classification is followed here, with some alternative names noted for clarity. Also provided are references to printed images of the script, but not to Barker’s edition, where all the scripts below, apart from lettre pattée, appear.</decoNote>
                     <decoNote>The prefatory material presents, in brief span, something of the range of scripts she intends to deploy, the dedicatory letter being in Hamon’s droicte (otherwise known as <foreign>littera antiqua</foreign> or roman), and the verses in italic (one slanted to the right, another to the left, ie couchée ou renversée, and yet another upright), ronde venecienne, lettre destat and lettre destat frizée. For the main text, the arrangement is as follows: <list>

                     <decoNote>The beauty of the scripts is set off by the orderly decoration of each page, with the textblock set within a frame with a bead and ball motif. Each psalm is preceded and followed by an ornamental bar or frieze, of varying designs. The decoration has some repeated designs, including sea monsters (fol. 5, 21, 36<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>), grotesques and a bell (fol. 6<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, 25, 44, 69<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>), sheep, goats, horses and cattle (fol. 4, 29<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, 47, 73<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>), a fictive slab inscribed with the date ‘1599’ (fol. 12, 28<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, 44<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, 49<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>. There are also two inhabited initials: fol. v (countryside with a city in the background) and 1<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> (a resting man with an army encampment in the middle ground, and a city in flames in the background; same motif at BL, MS Add. 27927, fol. 3). At fol. 1, there is a frieze of foliage and grapes, at centre of which sits a crowned lady, naked to the waist, with a lion seated, paws on the lady’s right knee, and a stag, the lady’s left arm embracing its neck; this faithfully reproduces the headpiece of the 1588 Geneva Bible, sig. *ij.</decoNote>

                        <p>Bound at the time of completion of the volume in spring 1599, with embroidered pink velvet over pasteboards made from re-used paper. The embroidery has beem assumed to be by Esther Inglis herself: Scott-Elliott and Yeo, ‘Calligraphic Manuscripts’, 21. There are similar, if less ornate, bindings on two of the other manuscripts she made at the same time, BL, MS Add. 27927, and Washington, DC: Folger Library, MS V.a.93. The binding on our manuscript is embroidered with stumpwork in silver, green and gold thread, and seed pearls, depicting a crowned Tudor Rose, surrounded by a laurel garland, within a border of flower motifs, on upper and lower boards. There is some damage, with lose of the top of the crown at the upper board, and some beads missing. Blue silk ties, now lost, edges gilt, rebacked in reverse calf. ChCh bookplate at inside of upper board.</p>

                  <provenance> As is made clear in its opening leaves, this manuscript was produced by Esther Inglis in Edinburgh for presentation to <persName key="person_97107753" role="fmo">Elizabeth, queen of England</persName>. Esther completed her work on 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> March 1599. In the days after that, she also completed other manuscripts, two intended for English recipients, Anthony Bacon (1558–1601), now BL, MS Add. 27927, and Bacon’s patron, Robert Devereux, earl of Essex (1565–1601), now Bod., MS Bodley 990, as well as one destined for Maurice of Nassau, prince of Orange (1567–1625), now Folger Library, MS V.a.93. Our manuscript (presumably along with these others) was taken south by her husband, Bartholomew Kello, together with a letter of recommendation for himself from James VI, king of Scotland, but he himself was not the presenter of the manuscript to the Queen. We know this from a letter that Kello wrote to the Queen on 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> July of the same year, following up on the presentation with a euphemistically phrased request for a reward; the letter survives at BL, MS Add. 4125, fol. 355, and is printed by Scott-Elliott and Yeo, ‘Calligraphic Manuscripts’, 35. Also relevant is the letter of the same date, which is BL, MS Add. 4125, fol. 354. Its addressee unnamed but we can surmise it was Anthony Bacon, to whom Kello states more explicitly his concern that the wait for a reward would exhaust its value because of his having to stay in England until he received it. That the situation was resolved very soon after that date is revealed by Kello’s next letter to the same person (BL, MS Add. 4125, fol. 357, also without addressee named), recalling that he had taken his leave of him on 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> July and sailed to Edinburgh on 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> July, reaching his homeland four days later. The contents of the letter also demonstrate that Kello had taken on the role of being Bacon’s informer. The context is discussed in outline by Georgianna Ziegler, ‘“More than Feminine Boldness”. The Gift Books of Esther Inglis’ in Mary E. Burke et al. ed., <title>Women, Writing, and the Reproduction of Culture in Tudor and Stuart Britain</title> (Syracuse, NY, 2000), 19–37 and, in more detail but with significant errors, by Susan Frye, ‘Materializing Authorship in Esther Inglis’s Books’, <title>Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies</title>, 32 (2002), 469–91 (where Kello’s correspondent in BL, MS Add. 4125 is mistakenly said to be Robert Cecil). </provenance>
                  <provenance> Elizabeth’s ownership of the manuscript is noted at the front pastedown, at both the top, deleted, ‘this booke was giuen to Queene Elizabeth’, and the centre, ‘This book was queen Elizabeths’. A misreading of the first of these notes led Thomas Hearne, who saw the manuscript in Christ Church in 1706, to assume that it had been given to the House by her (<title>Remarks</title>, 1:174–175). In truth, it had a slightly more varied life. A note at top of the first flyleaf (fol. i) records ‘<persName key="person_2663" role="fmo">Anne Ancram</persName> her book’. This is Anne, only daughter of William Stanley, 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> earl of Derby, by Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Edward Vere, 17th earl of Oxford (they married 26 January 1595); Anne first married Sir Henry Portman of Orchard Portman, Somerset, who died 21 February 1621, and, at the end of the same year, she took as her second husband Robert Ker, who was made 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> earl of Ancram on 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> June 1633 (on whom, see David Stevenson in <title>Oxford DNB</title>). As a royalist, the earl went into exile following the execution of Charles I and died in Amsterdam in December 1654; his wife remained in Britain and was buried at Westminster Abbey on 15 February 1657 (<title>Scots Peerage</title>, V.467). The <foreign>terminus ante quem non</foreign> for the ownership note, thirty years after the queen’s death, strongly suggests that we should dispense with any assumption that Elizabeth gave our manuscript directly to Anne who, at that time, could have been no more than a toddler (Frye, ‘Materializing Authorship’, 474).</provenance>
                  <provenance>It was the Countess herself who presented the book to ChCh, as is recorded in the Donors’ Book, p. 109ª, under the year 1654: ‘Nobilissima Heroina Anna Comitissa d’ Ancram pro Sua in Rem Literariam Benevolentia, et in Sexus sui Honorem, D.D. insignem Libellum complectentem Psalmos Davidis Gallico Idiomati Fœmineo Calamo exaratos, vario Charactere, et ad virorum invidiam Eleganti. Qui vel eo Nomine gratior accedit quod olim Dominam suam habuit Serenissimam Principem Elizabetham’. What occasioned this donation by a royalist wife to a royal foundation is unclear. The note in the Donors’ Book reflects the interest in the gender of its scribe, echoed in the 1676 Catalogue (where it is number <hi rend="bold">[22]</hi>) and in Thomas Hearne’s comments, mentioned above, on this ‘most curious book’. It has been central to later discussions of the œuvre of Esther Inglis. It was mentioned by George Ballard in his <title>Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain</title> (London, 1752), 267–70 (268), repeating Hearne’s error about the donor to ChCh (Ballard also mentions that Inglis’s son, Samuel Kello, attended Christ Church). It was later recorded by Laing, ‘Notes relating to Esther Inglis’, no. III; Dorothy Judd Jackson, <title>Esther Inglis Calligrapher 1571–1624</title>[privately printed] (New York, 1937) as no. III; and by Scott-Elliott and Yeo, ‘Calligraphic Manuscripts’ as no. 7. </provenance>
                  <provenance> The volume contains, at the centre of the first flyleaf, fol. i, the New Library shelfmark ‘C.3’, deleted (see Appendix IV). </provenance>
