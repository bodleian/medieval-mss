                     <p>A collection of eleven letters, loose, unbound, and in a now-disintegrating coarse paper wrapper (s. xix), they are presently held in a guard box with photostats and other material relevant to the items. Now ordered chronologically but previously followed a different order, as shown by the pencil foliation (s. xix) at top right, which itself superseded another order, arranged by a system of the letter D (for Dorsett) followed by a number, written in pencil and later over-written in pen at top left (s. xviii; see <hi rend="smallcaps">provenance</hi>). Each letter also has written in pen at top centre, in another hand (s. xix), its date of composition. Because of their status as independent items, each letter is described individually below.</p>
                     <p>All are written by one hand, that of <persName key="person_90569077" role="scr">Robert Dorsett</persName>, employing an italic script which is often calligraphic in its aspect, though in some items, particularly item 11, it is more current. Dorsett (?1546–1580) was educated at Christ Church, being a student from 1561, and taking his BA 1 February 1565, MA 9 July 1567, supplicating for BD 3 September 1575 and being awarded DD April 1579; he was ordained deacon 30 November 1568 and priest 24 October 1572; he was appointed rector of Winwick (Northants) in the same year and, two years later, on 15 May 1574, instituted rector of Ewelme where, it would seem, he established his family home; he was appointed dean of Chester in 1579 but died 29 May 1580 and was buried in Ewelme (<title>AO</title>; CCEd). He was deeply involved in ChCh matters in the mid-1570s, pressing the cause (as he mentions in our item 1) for William James (on whom, see item 11) to be appointed Dean rather than Tobie Matthew; his letters to the Queen and the earl of Leicester gained a small circulation, surviving in CUL, MS Mm.i.49 (Baker 38), Bod., MSS Top. Oxon e. 5 and Auct F.5.13. He served as tutor to Philip Sidney and to his younger brother, Robert, who is mentioned several times in these letters; he was also the dedicatee of poems by William Gager (on whom, see our MS 486). He married, his wife dying in the same year as him (Roger Kuin, <title>The Correspondence of Sir Philip Sidney</title>, 2 vols (Oxford, 2012), 1:xli surmises that they succumbed to the plague); they left a two-year-old daughter, who grew up to be, as Martha Moulsworth, a poetess, and who was to write affectionately of a father she could only dimly remember in her autobiography, uniquely extant in Yale University: Beinecke Library, MS Osborn fb150, and edited by Robert C. Evans and Barabara Wiedemann, <title>‘My Names was Martha’. A Renaissance Woman’s Autobiographical Poem</title> (West Cornwall CT, 1993); for discussion, see the essays in Robert C. Evans and Anne C. Little, <title>‘The Muses Females Are’. Martha Moulsworth and other Women Writers of the English Renaissance</title> (West Cornwall CT, 1995), and Elizabeth Mazzola, <title>Learning and literacy in female hands, 1520–1698</title>, Farnham, 2013), 91–93; see also Matthew Steggle, ‘The text and attribution of “Thou who dost all my earthly thoughts employ”: a new Moulsworth poem?’, <title>Early Modern Literary Studies</title>, 6 (2001), 3.1–8 [freely available on-line].</p>

                  <provenance> The letters which share this manuscript number appeared at auction in Sotheby’s London rooms on 26 June 1967 as lot 742. They had, in fact, arrived at the auction house as part of a larger collection of seventy-six letters, all of which came from the collection of <persName key="person_73979081" role="fmo">Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792–1872)</persName>. They had reached that bibliomaniac from the collection of the antiquary <persName key="person_7818669" role="fmo">Benjamin Heywood Bright (1787–1843)</persName>, whose manuscripts were sold by Sotheby’s on 18 June 1844, with the full seventy-six letters appearing as no. 243 (Schoenberg database, no. 20669; a label with the number appears on the coarse paper wrapper once covering the letters) and being sold to the bookseller Payne for £50 (hand-written note in Bodleian copy); Phillipps presumably purchased the collection from or via Payne. It became his MS 11762. When it re-appeared at auction, Sotheby’s divided up the set, with the majority sold separately from those from Robert Dorsett and with ChCh purchasing those written by its former Canon with assistance from the Friends of the National Libraries (the purchase and its contents is described briefly by J. F. A. Mason in the Friends’ Annual Report for 1967, 8–9). The remaining sixty-five letters were bought by James M. Osborn, who announced their significance in ‘New Light on Sir Philip Sidney’, <title>Times Literary Supplement</title>, 30 April 1970, 487, and subsequently used them, and the ones now in ChCh, as the basis for his volume <title>Young Philip Sidney</title>. The letters he bought are now Yale University, Beinecke Library, Osborn fa14. </provenance>
                  <provenance>The earlier history of the collection from which MS 578 comes has been shrewdly reconstructed by Roger Kuin (<title>Correspondence</title>, 1:xxv-xxix). He surmises that a yet larger collection of Sidney letters – which he denotes as ‘X’ – was held at Penshurst but left there and appeared at auction in London, as several lots, on 9 April 1811. The main buyer was <persName key="person_121937048" role="fmo">James Bindley (1737–1818)</persName>, who obtained those letters which were, following his death, purchased by Bright. Other letters from ‘X’ followed various routes from the 1811 sale to find themselves eventually in the British Library (in MSS Add. 15914, 17520, 18675 and 21522); some, however, remain unaccounted for and Kuin provides a tentative reconstruction of what is presently lost (<title>Correspondence</title>, 2:1331).</provenance>
                  <provenance>It might be added that, early in their life, there had clearly been some attempts to identify and order the letters. First, there were the added endorsements to items 4–8, with similar additions being found on other letters in ‘X’ (for an example from the Yale Osborn collection, see Kuin, <title>Correspondence</title>, 1:pl. 1, noting that that addition is in English while, as our items 4 and 7 demonstrate, those here are in the same script but in Italian). Later (seemingly in the eighteenth century), a system of a letter and a number was added above the opening of each letter, where the letter was the first of the correspondent’s surname, so, for instance, our item 1 was D27 (these annotations are explained by Kuin, <title>Correspondence</title>, 1:xxvi). In other words, though the appearance of the two lots at the Sotheby’s sale in 1967 was, as Osborn declared in his <title>TLS</title> article, a revelation to Sidney scholars, there had been a long history of respecting them as evidence of his life and contemporary standing. </provenance>

                        <note> Verso blank, except for the remains of a note, written vertically, in same hand as that seen adding a note to item 4: ‘novembris L:’. This demonstrates there is a loss of a vertical strip from the left-hand edge of recto, which is now strengthened by a paper strip. As a result, the left-hand margin before the text is not as ample as usual, being 30mm. The text extends to very right edge of folio, and the correspondent’s signature sits at the very bottom of the page, now damaged. </note>

James’. <persName key="person_45435991">William James (d. 1617)</persName> was a Houseman (BA 1562, MA 1566, BA 1572, DD 1574), and, at the time of this letter, Master of University College; he had been proposed for the Deanship, as mentioned in the text of item 1 above, but was preferred to that position only in 1584, holding it until his translation to the Deanery of Durham in 1596; he was promoted to that bishopric in 1606, but his episcopacy was to prove contentious (Michael Tillbrook in <title>Oxford DNB</title>; <title>AO</title>). At the verso of the second folio, written vertically, are some scribbled calculations in pounds sterling.</note>
