                     <note>Ed. Hermann Oesterley (1872; rep. Hildesheim, 1963), without reference to this copy; that edition is in the process of being superseded by one for Oxford Medieval Texts based upon Anglo-Latin copies, by Philippa Bright and Diane Speed. Text followed (fols 149<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>-53) by an index with headings for the 110 sections. A large amount of textual correction in the first fifteen leaves.</note>
                     <note> The exact transmission of the text remains unclear, but copies produced in England clearly differ radically in contents and order from continental ones; see Walter Röll, ‘Zur Überlieferungsgeschichte der “Gesta Romanorum”’, <title>Mittellateinisches Jahrbuch</title>, 21 (1986), 208–29. This MS appears to agree in many respects with those English copies described by J. A. Herbert, <title>Catalogue of Romances in . . . the British Museum</title>, 3 (London, 1910), 183–229. For example, the contents table in BL MS Harley 2270 has the same incipit and explicit as our manuscript, as well as the same five anecdotes at the head and at the end (with some disordering of the tales at the end), and a comparable total of 102 stories (213–15). Also similar at incipit and explicit are, <foreign>inter alia</foreign>, MSS Harley 5369 and 5259 (191, 197–98 and 199, 212, respectively). Our manuscript does not appear in the listing of witnesses provided by Brigitte Weiske, <title>Gesta Romanorum,</title>2 vols [Fortuna Vitrea, 3 &amp; 4] (Tübingen, 1992), 2:121–44, or in the addenda provided by Philippa Bright, ‘Anglo-Latin Collections of the <title>Gesta Romanorum</title> and their Role in the Cure of Souls’ in Juanita Feros Ruys ed., <title>What Nature does not Teach. Didactic Literature in the Medieval and Early-Modern Periods</title>(Turnhout, 2008), 401–424 (404n).</note>

                  <provenance notAfter="1575" notBefore="1550"> As, given the date of donation, the placing of the chain-staple does not accord with ChCh practice (on this generally, see Introduction, ‘Christ Church, From Foundation’, and see Appendix I), the mark is presumably evidence of this manuscript’s place in an institutional collection. By the third quarter of the sixteenth century, it appears to be circulating in private hands: there are several notes many erased, some only <foreign>probationes pennae</foreign> – written, usually upside down in the lower margin. They are contributions from perhaps fifteen individuals, and they provide a series of names, including ‘<persName key="person_2594" role="sgn">Henrys mywyn</persName>’ (fol. 17), and ‘<persName key="person_2595" role="sgn">John Stoodlinge</persName>’ (fol. 72<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>); at fol. 114<hi rend="superscript">v</hi> a schoolboy manifestly fibs when he scrawls ‘<persName key="person_2596">Edward Corrocke</persName> ys A good boye wytnes of <persName key="person_2597">Davide phillip Ane</persName>’ (Corrock’s name also occurs at fol. 132<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>). Dated entries include the opening of an indenture ‘20 May 20 Elizabeth’ (fol. 90, upside down in the lower margin); and a note of ‘1560’ and ‘2 Elizabeth’ mentioning one ‘llewelin’ and ‘<persName key="person_2598">John Lloyd</persName>’ (fol. 153<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>).</provenance>
                  <provenance> These notes point to a <placeName key="place_7008052">Glamorgan</placeName> provenance; the county appears explicitly in the opening of an indenture by ‘<persName key="person_2599">Thomas <gap quantity="5" unit="char"/></persName>’, with a reference to a locale in the county no longer legible (fol. 110) and the note ‘Memorandum that I <persName key="person_2600">Adam Mychell of the parich of Luntwit in the counteye of glamorgane yeman</persName>’ (fol. i<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>). The place name in that entry helps provide narrower localisation, as do the following notes: ‘This byll witnessith that I <persName key="person_2601">Iohn Spenser of flominyn</persName> hath’ (fol. 73, the upper margin, perhaps earlier s. xvi); ‘The person of Lammayse hath a sarvay(n)t dothe stele all thinge that She may com by truth ys so to be hind’ (fol. 101, the lower margin, upside down); ‘this writynghe was done at bovebone <supplied>....scraped</supplied>‘ (fol. 109<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, the lower margin, upside down). The represent towns and villages in south-west Glamorgan, near the Bristol Channel: ‘Luntwit’ is likely to be <placeName key="place_7008505">Llantwit Major</placeName> with ‘flominyn’ perhaps <placeName key="place_7449469">Flemingston</placeName>, a dozen miles north-east of Llantwit; ‘Lammyse’ is surely <placeName key="place_7444953">Llanmaes</placeName>, just five miles north, and ‘bovebone’ <placeName key="place_7465084">Boverton</placeName>, three miles east of Llantwit. The last of these is the home settlement of the man who was later to donate the volume to ChCh. This geographical concentration should encourage us to speculate that the institution from which this manuscript was ‘liberated’ was a nearby religious house, of which the most plausible candidate in the proximity would be the Cistercian Abbey of <orgName cert="low" key="org_135058831" role="fmo">Margam</orgName>, seventeen miles from Boverton, and from whose library 242 titles were recorded in the <title>Registrum</title> (289–91), though by the fifteenth century its wealth and significance had declined; MLGB3 records four extant volumes. </provenance>
