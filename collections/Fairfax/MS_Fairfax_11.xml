                     <note>Written in black, red, blue and gold, laid out one month per page, graded to nine lessons. Feasts in red include Ambrose (4 April), Augustine of Canterbury (26 May), Thomas Becket and his translation (29 December and 7 July), Augustine of Hippo (28 August), Thomas of Hereford (2 October), the translation of Edward the Confessor (13 October) and Edmund Rich (16 November). On 2 March, <q>Theaddee</q>, bishop, in red, as <q>festum duplex</q>, marked <q>non sarum</q> in the original hand (Chad (?), promulgated in 1415). Wulstan, bishop of Worcester (19 January) is in black, his translation (7 June) is in black marked <q>non sarum</q>. Thomas of Hereford, though a non-Sarum saint, is not marked as such. Includes Richard of Chichester (3 April), but not John of Beverley, David, Frideswide or Winifred (promulgated in 1415 under archbishop Chichele; see Pfaff, R. W., <title>The liturgy in medieval England: a history</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), pp. 440–1). Does not include Botulph (17 June). The months are headed by notes on the number of hours in day and night, and verses on the ‘Egyptian’ days which correspond to Hennig, J., ‘Versus de mensibus’, <title>Traditio</title> 11 (1955), pp. 65–90, set III. The feasts of Thomas Becket are not erased. Added numbering of the days of the months in an early modern hand.</note>

The readings consist of the name of a liturgical occasion in red, abbreviated reference to a book and chapter of the Bible, an indexing letter in red, the opening words of a reading, <q>ende</q> in red and the closing words of a reading. Larger initials with penwork at Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Pentecost, Trinity, Conception of our Lady and Candlemas.</note>

                        <p>Brown leather over pasteboard, late 17th century, probably made for Charles Fairfax. Blind fillet-line and roll borders on both covers with floral cornerpieces and floral decorations at the centre. Imprints from metal decorations at the centre and around the edges of covers. The metal decorations were added on top of blind-tool designs on the binding, presumably soon after it was made, and left holes and rust marks on fols. ii–2 and 196–200. Fols. ii, iii, 199 and 200 are medieval parchment flyleaves. Fols. ii and 200 served as pastedowns of a medieval binding and have imprints from a medieval document. Heavily repaired and rebacked in the Bodleian; 19th-century spine and paper flyleaves. Five raised bands on spine, framed by blind fillet lines. Gold lettering on spine ‘MS. <lb/> FAIRFAX <lb/> 11’.</p>

                     <p>Probably made in London for a patron connected to Hereford cathedral (see Solopova, E., ‘Manuscript Evidence for the Patronage, Ownership and Use of the Wycliffite Bible’, in Poleg, E. and Light, L. (eds), <title>Form and Function in the Late Medieval Bible</title> (Leiden: Brill, 2013), pp. 333–49). The calendar may have been made for a church of Augustinian canons: it is graded to nine lessons in accordance with secular use; Augustine of Hippo and Ambrose are in red, Ambrose is <q>festum duplex</q>. The feast (19 January) and translation (7 June) of Wulstan, bishop of Worcester, who undertook rebuilding work in Hereford cathedral and churches in Hereford, are included in black. The feast (19 January) is often present in the 15th-century Sarum calendars, whereas the translation is a non-Sarum feast (marked as such in the calendar) and is rare. Thomas of Hereford, a non-Sarum saint, is in red, graded to nine lessons. It is unlikely that the manuscript was made for the diocese or cathedral of Worcester, because of the absence of Worcester feasts, apart from Wulstan, and the fact that the calendar is graded for secular use.</p>
                     <p>Written by the same scribe as MS. Bodl. 183, and illuminated by the same artist; MS. Bodl. 665 may be also the work of this scribe (de Hamel, C., <title>The book: a history of the Bible</title> (London: Phaidon, 2001)); see, however, Peikola, M., ‘The Wycliffite Bible and “Central Midland Standard”: assessing the manuscript evidence’, <title>Nordic Journal of English Studies</title> 2 (2003), pp. 29–51, pp. 39–40. Probably not made in Hereford, which preserved its distinctive use in the late Middle Ages (Pfaff, R. W., <title>The liturgy in medieval England: a history</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), pp. 466–80); does not include Æthelberht (20 May), a non-Sarum feast. Written before 1415 (?): does not include most saints promulgated under archbishop Chichele; Chad (?) is marked as ‘non-Sarum’.</p>
