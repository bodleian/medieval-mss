                           red lines), in several different hands, added soon after the manuscript
                           was made. The texts include psalm 5 (Uerba mea auribus percipe ...’)
                           (fols. 1v–2v), hymn Hec dies quam fecit dominus ... (Chevalier, no. 7585)
                           with music (fol. 3r), invitatoria with rubrics (fol. 3v), possibly the
                           earliest addition. 17th-century corrections in the margins. Fol. i is a

                        <note> Psalms in the order Sunday Matins, Sunday Lauds, Little Hours,
                           Vespers on Sunday and during the week, and Compline in secular use, laid
                           out with each verse starting on a new line, some with titles ‘psalmus’ or
                           ‘psalmus dauid’, without numbers. Punctuated throughout with punctus
                           flexus used to mark minor pauses, colon used to mark metrum, and punctus
                           used to mark the ends of verses. The verses with punctus flexus are
                           identified with a special sign in the margins, sometimes decorated with
                           penwork human profiles (cf. MS. Lat. liturg. a. 3). The psalms are
                           accompanied by antiphons, versicles and invitatoria with rubrics and
                           music (square notation on staves of four red lines). Subdivisions within
                           psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into eleven
                           16-verse units. The text contains corrections in contemporary and later
                           hands. Psalm 109 (Vespers) starts on a new quire. The scribe ran out of
                           space on the preceding quire and completed the sequence for None, which
                           comes immediately before Vespers, on an added bifolium. Most of the
                           second leaf (fol. 75) of the bifolium was originally left blank, but in
                           the 16th century the verso was filled with Regina celi (see below).

                        <p> Brown leather over pasteboard, 19th century (perhaps made for the
                           Bodleian). Borders on both covers made of crossing single and triple
                           blind fillet lines. Originally there were five false raised bands on
                           spine, framed by triple blind fillet lines, but three are now missing.
                           Gilt lettering on spine ‘PSALTERUM’ and ‘MS’. Paper pastedowns and
                           fly-leaves, no watermarks. Floral blind roll decorations on turn-ins and
                           edges of covers. Fols. ii and 122 (parchment with paper pasted to the
                           side facing the cover) were the pastedowns of an earlier 17th-century
