This suggestion was probably based on the fact that the volumes from which the fragments were recovered were printed in Paris in 1538 and 1539: according to a note on fol. 2r, "Folios 1 and 2 [ ...."tis invicem"... and "placuit ei"] are taken, Folio 1 from the lower cover, Folio 2 from the upper cover, of "Omnium Gentium mores, leges et ritus ..... a Ioanne Boemo Aubano, Teutonico nuper collecti, et novissime recogniti.

Small octavo brown calf over (?)beech boards, diagonal blind lines in blind border: one clasp catch on each cover: initials G. G. (? Gough) impressed in centre of both covers. Folios 3 and 4 [.."S. apostolorum" and "per Dominum"] are taken from the covers of "Ex variis libellis Eliae grammaticorum omnium doctissimi, huc fere congestum est opera Iohannis Campensis, quidquid ad absolutam grammaticen Hebraicam est necessarium ....
