Bodl. 579). Other fragments of the same MS. are: <list>

Oxford bindings, and it was suggested in the Sotheby's catalogue that the book may have been taken from Exeter to Exeter College, Oxford (founded in 1314), and discarded at the Reformation; a very faint inscription in 14th-cent. cursive script in the upper right margin of fol. 13v appears to read "Henr'[...] p[er?] [...] R[...] | h[...]h" (??), perhaps including the name of a reader.</provenance>

This suggestion was probably based on the fact that the volumes from which the fragments were recovered were printed in Paris in 1538 and 1539: according to a note on fol. 2r, "Folios 1 and 2 [ ...."tis invicem"... and "placuit ei"] are taken, Folio 1 from the lower cover, Folio 2 from the upper cover, of "Omnium Gentium mores, leges et ritus ..... a Ioanne Boemo Aubano, Teutonico nuper collecti, et novissime recogniti.

Small octavo brown calf over (?)beech boards, diagonal blind lines in blind border: one clasp catch on each cover: initials G. G. (? Gough) impressed in centre of both covers. Folios 3 and 4 [.."S. apostolorum" and "per Dominum"] are taken from the covers of "Ex variis libellis Eliae grammaticorum omnium doctissimi, huc fere congestum est opera Iohannis Campensis, quidquid ad absolutam grammaticen Hebraicam est necessarium .... Parisiis apud Christianum Wechelum. MDXXXIX" (N.B.: Gambier-Parry's Folios 1, 2, 3, and 4, are now fols. 7, 8, 13, and 14, respectively). </provenance>
