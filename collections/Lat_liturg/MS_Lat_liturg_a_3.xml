                        <note> Psalms for Matins and Lauds during the week in secular use, laid out
                           with each verse starting on a new line, some with titles ‘psalmus’ or
                           ‘psalmus dauid’, without numbers. Punctuated throughout with punctus
                           flexus used to mark minor pauses, colon used to mark metrum, and punctus
                           used to mark the ends of verses. Verses with punctus flexus are
                           identified with a special sign in the margins, sometimes decorated with
                           penwork human profiles (cf. MS. Lat. liturg. a. 2). The psalms are
                           accompanied by antiphons, versicles and invitatoria with rubrics and
                           music (square notation on staves of four red lines). Subdivisions within
                           psalms are not indicated. The text contains corrections in contemporary
                           and later hands. Psalms and weekly canticles are in the following order: <list>

                     of antiphons for days of the week was added on fol. ii verso. At the same time
                     the manuscript was foliated, rebound and repaired with strips of parchment and
                     paper. </provenance>
