                        and Roman and Holy Roman emperors. Fols. 16–18v have separate lines for the

                        <extent>The manuscript is a roll, folded in concertina fashion; see A. C. de
                           la Mare, <title>Catalogue of the Collection of Medieval Manuscripts
                              bequeathed to the Bodleian Library Oxford by James P. R. Lyell</title>

                           Thus, each ‘folio’ in fact presents two consecutive sections of the
                           original recto of the roll, and the original blank dorse falls between
                           the ‘recto’ and ‘verso’ of each folio. Consequently, the text must be
                           read beginning at the gutter and ending at the leading edge for rectos,
                           and from the leading edge back to the gutter for versos. The original
                           document comprised 21 folios, numbered to 22. Fol. 1 is not in
                           concertina, but the head of the roll, with the recto the blank dorse, and
                           the text beginning on the recto of the original roll, now fol. 1v. Fol. 4
                           has been split and fol. 4 now numbered 4 (with blank dorse) and its
                           original ‘verso’ now numbered 5 (with blank recto). And the original
                           final ‘folio’ was the tail of the roll, written on the recto only, now
                           fol. 22; this has been cut off 60 mm shorter than the other ‘folios’. To
                           this original production have been added (a) a new ‘foot’ to fol. 22 and
                           its extension as fol. 22v; (b) three additional leaves, fols. 23–5, all
                           only a recto and its dorse. Fol. 24, written on the recto only in a hand
                           which appears elsewhere (see Added Texts [b] and Binding) is probably the
                           blank lower half of fol. 22. Thus, as now bound, there are ii + <measure type="leaf" quantity="24">24</measure> (numbered to 25) + ii (numbered
                           fols. iii–iv) folios. Overall, the original roll measured 9225 mm x 340
                           mm (including full dimensions for fol. 22 and assuming fol. 24 was the
                           end of the roll); as bound, with the horizontal dimension now the height
                           of the page, each full leaf is 340 mm x 225 mm. To this has been added
                           the extra 60 mm at the leading edge of fol. 22 and a further 675 mm
                           (fols. 22v, 23, and 25).</extent>
