                        partially collated as ‘N’ (and briefly described, 1: p. liii). The editors
                        state (1: p. xxxv) that the text is closely related to that of <bibl type="ms">BodL, MS Bodley 277</bibl>; and <bibl type="ms">Cambridge,
                           Corpus Christi College MS 147</bibl>. The books are in the usual order,
                        but Psalms is omitted (at <locus from="156vb" to="156vb">fol. 156<hi rend="superscript">vb</hi></locus>). There are only two prologues: the
                        general prologue to the prophets preceding Isaiah (<locus from="183va" to="183va">fol. 183<hi rend="superscript">va</hi></locus>, <bibl>edn.

                                 incomplete (and may have an erasure at the end), and it is possible
                                 that a further booklet with New Testament materials

Chapter numbers in red, preceded by blue paraphs, usually in the form <q>c<ex>apitulu</ex>m iiᵐ</q>; instructions to rubricator are often preserved, usually as Arabic numerals. Glosses in the margins very occasionally, usually boxed in black and red. <q>Nota</q> in the margins occasionally, in black ink often traced in red, probably in the original hand, marking various passages, including those concerned with the use of images and idolatry (<q>nota þe cause of pees</q> at 2 Chronicles 14:5, fol. 125r; <q>nota</q> at 2 Chronicles 15:16, fol. 125v; Wisdom 13:13, fol. 169v; <q>nota ymages</q> at Wisdom 14:11, fol. 169v); tithes (2 Chronicles 31:4, fol. 130r); and kingship (Ecclesiastes 10:16–17, fol. 165r). Lections are not marked, though indexing letters very occasionally appear in the margins. Added indexing letters on fol. 35r and occasionally elsewhere. Added material within the text is underlined in red consistently throughout. ‘Hedera’ signs in the margins. Corrections in the original or contemporary hands. Red and blue paraphs at the beginning of sections within the text. Usual rubrics commenting on the differences between the Latin and Hebrew texts in Esther 10–16 and Daniel 3, 12.

<p>Production break after Job (ends with a shorter than normal quire of four leaves); psalms are missing; Proverbs starts on a new quire. Ends with a shorter than normal quire, but a rubric implies that more material was expected to be added, possibly the New Testament. Missing two quires at the beginning may have contained the General Prologue. Three quires missing between the quires 18 and 23 may have contained psalms, though there is a catchword in red, probably in the hand of the original rubricator, joining the end of Job and Proverbs.</p>
