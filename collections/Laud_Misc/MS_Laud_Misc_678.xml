                     <title key="work_11053" type="desc">'Codex Laud' or 'Codex Mictlan': Mesoamerican pictorial screenfold manuscript</title>
                     <note>Based on the 260-day calendarial cycle ('tonalpohualli'), with its division into 20 'trecenas' of 13 days, illustrated with appropriate rituals and offerings used in divination; part of the so-called 'Borgia Group' or 'Teoamoxtli Group' of divinatory-ritual books.</note>
                     <note>Aspects of the sequence and interpretation of the images are disputed. The account given here is abbreviated form the content summary in Elizabeth Hill Boone, <title>Cycles of Time and Meaning in the Mexican Books of Fate</title> (2007), 246-8, which should be consulted for more detail and for a diagrammatic representation. For other interpretations differing in some respects see Ferdinand Anders and Maarten Jensen, with a contribution by Alejandra Cruz Ortiz, <title>La pintura de la muerte y de los destinos. Libro explicativo del llamado Códice Laud</title> (Mexico City, 1994), and Araceli Rojas, <title>Notes on the Manufacture, Colours, and Biography of Codex Laud.
