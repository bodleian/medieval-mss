Running titles on both rectos and versos consisting of a short title of a biblical book in black preceded by a blue paraph (longer titles are split between facing pages).

No marginal glosses (an exception on fol. 23v); added material within the text is not underlined. The beginnings of lections are usually marked with indexing letters in the margins (and often with blue paraphs within the text); the ends of lections are marked with double strokes in the margins. Occasionally corrections in the original or contemporary hands. A Greek gloss added in an early modern hand on fol. 65r.</note>

The temporal is followed by an extensive sanctoral (rubric, <q>þe propre and comyn togidere</q> fol. 287) and commemorations <locus>(fol. 296r)</locus>. On fol. 297v about a half of the first column is left blank after the end of commemorations; the next column starts with a rubric introducing the readings for the common of saints, but these are mostly missing because of the loss of leaves (see Collation). Each reading is preceded by a rubric, stating the liturgical occasion, the title of the biblical book and the chapter number. Short titles and chapter numbers of biblical books, as well as the indexing letters, are also placed in the margins before the start of each reading and double strokes at the end of each reading up to fol. 271r; after this only the indexing letters and double strokes are present.</note>
                     <note>The readings begin with the statements that introduce them at Mass (e.g., <q>The lord god seiþ þese þingis</q>, fol. 258r) underlined in red. The readings used for more than one occasion are not repeated and instead the rubrics contain references to leaves on which they occur, using foliation in Roman numerals in the original hand (medieval foliation is present only in the part of the manuscript containing Old Testament lectionary). The method of reference is explained in a rubric on fol. 282r: <q>þis lessoun ȝe schulen fynde writen al out to fore in þe .xxv. leef of þese leefes þat ben markid. In whiche leefes ben conteyned alle þe lessons &amp; pistlis of þe oolde lawe. and þei ben markid wiþ lettris of noumbrari as is i. ij. &amp; iij. on þe riȝtside of þe leef. in þe hiȝer part of þe margyn</q>. The reading for the first Mass on Christmas morning is preceded by a lengthy rubric explaining that it is performed by two voices; the part of one of the voices is underlined in red in the text that follows <locus>(fol. 260r)</locus>. Added material within the text is underlined in red; no marginal glosses. Fols. 298–301 are parchment and paper flyleaves (see Provenance).</note>

Calendar, fairly sparse, based on a Sarum model, includes Erkenwald, bishop of London, a non-Sarum saint, and the principal saint of St Paul’s (though not his translation, 14 December). Conversion of St Paul (25 January), Peter and Paul (29 June) and its octave are in red (the octave is missing in the calendar of MS. Fairfax 11 and is in black in the calendar of MS. Fairfax 2); Commemoration of St Paul (30 June) is included. Contains some, but not all saints promulgated in 1415; the presence of only one distinctly London saint may suggest a date after the suppression of the use of St Paul in 1414 (Pfaff, R. W., <title>The liturgy in medieval England: a history</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), pp. 480–96). Added material within the text is underlined only in Old Testament lectionary.</p>

                  <provenance>Preacher’s or theological notes in English, 15th century, second half, added on fol. iv verso, some Lollard, e.g., those drawing attention to passages against beggars, against <q>idle men that live off other men’s labour</q> and to a passage against the scribes and Pharisees, Matthew 23:13, widely used in Lollard discourse (e.g., Hudson, A. and Gradon, P., <title>English Wycliffite sermons</title>, 5 vols (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983–96), vol. 2, pp. 366–78). Liturgical notes in Latin, possibly in the same hand, on fols. 124v, 183v and 210v. Possibly in London when the notes were made: those on fol. iv verso draw attention to a passage describing the conversion of St Paul; liturgical notes on fol. 210v mention the feasts of Paul. The notes on fol. iv verso have some southern forms (plurals <q>holdyth</q> and <q>lefyth</q>). The notes may be in the hand of one of the 15th-century owners, Henry Tyryll or Christopher Constable: <q>per me henricum tyryll</q> and <q>per me christoferum constable</q>
