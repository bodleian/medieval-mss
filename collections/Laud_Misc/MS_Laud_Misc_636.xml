               <msContents>
                  <summary>The so-called Anglo-Saxon chronicle was originally compiled in King Alfred's reign and perhaps with his encouragement, and was continued in several versions after his death (Irvine 2015). This manuscript, copied at Peterborough Abbey, is the only version to continue beyond 1079, and is an almost unique witness to historical writing in Old English in the early twelfth century. The later annals are particularly celebrated for the supposedly eye-witness description of William the Conqueror, and for their evidence of linguistic change from Old English to Middle English.</summary>

                     <note>The text is written to the end of the last line of fol. 91v, so the manuscript may 'possibly but not very probably' (Ker) be incomplete.That the manuscript was compiled and written at Peterborough is shown by local entries not found in other manuscript of the Chronicle; local entries for 1041 and 1052 were added in the margin "in the ink and hand of the text" (Ker). The production of the chronicle to 1131 is discussed in more detail by Irvine (2010).</note>
