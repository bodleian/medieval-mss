                        <note> Calendar, laid out one month per page, with major feasts in gold, and
                           others in blue, red or brown; approximately three-quarters full, graded
                           to 12 lessons, ‘in cappis’ and ‘in albis’, with some 15th-century
                           additions (ed. Tolhurst, 1932–42, vol. v). Includes the feast of Judoc
                           (13 December) and his translation (9 January), both in gold as duplex
                           festum, and the octave of the translation in red (16 January). Grimbald
                           of Winchester is added as duplex festum in a 15th-century hand (8 July)
                           with the octave in the original hand (15 July); the translation of
                           Grimbald is added in the same hand (3 September). The shrines of both
                           saints were at the Benedictine Abbey at Hyde near Winchester. Valentine,
                           Barnabas and Edmund are each in gold as duplex festum (14 February, 11
                           June and 16 November). The head of Valentine was an important relic at
                           Hyde and Sts Valentine, Barnabas and Grimbald appear on the 13th-century
                           seal of the Abbey (de Gray Birch, 1892, p. lxx). The calendar also
                           includes obits (in the original hand) of kings Alfred (26 October) and
                           Edward the Elder (17 July), and Queen Emma (6 March), all buried at Hyde,
                           and several monks, priors and abbots of Hyde, the last one being Abbot
                           Robert de Popham, who died in 1292 (Tolhurst, 1934, vol. i, p. xi). Some
                           of the text that was intended to be written in gold seems to have been
                           left unfinished, as the entry for Barnabas is incomplete and spaces are
                           left blank for the feasts of Grimbald. Many entries are followed by the
                           incipits of the antiphons to the Magnificat at Vespers. The months are
                           headed by verses on the ‘Egyptian’ days (e.g. ‘Prima dies mensis et
                           septima truncat ut ensis’, etc.) which correspond to Hennig’s (1955) set
                           III, and a note on the number of days in a month, and on the number of
                           hours in day and night (the last is repeated at the end of each month).
                           The 15th-century additions to the calendar include Alban (22 June),
                           Martin of Tours (ordinatio, 4 July), Etheldreda (17 October) and Eleven
                           Thousand Virgins (21 October). The feasts of Thomas Becket are erased,
                           but not the octave in January (and not his name in the litany).</note>

                        <note> Psalms [1]–150, laid out in two columns, with each verse starting on
                           a new line, without titles. The numbers of some psalms are added in the
                           margins in an early modern hand. The psalms are punctuated throughout
                           with punctus used to mark the ends of verses and minor pauses, and
                           punctus elevatus used to mark metrum. The psalms contain corrections in
                           the original hand and are imperfect at the beginning owing to the loss of
                           the first leaf, starting at ‘Quoniam non est ...’ (6: 6). The following
                           text is also missing owing to the loss of two leaves: 36: 8–38: 2 (after
                           fol. 20) and 93: 5–97: 1 (after fol. 41). The psalms are in the biblical
                           order; the subdivisions within psalms are marked with two-line initials
                           at 9: 20 (fol. 12v), 17: 26 (fol. 15r), 67: 20 (fol. 30v), 68: 17 (fol.
                           31r), 77: 36 (fol. 34v), 88: 20 (fol. 40r), 103: 25 (fol. 43v), 104: 23
                           (fol. 44r), 105: 32 (fol. 45r), 106: 25 (fol. 46r), 138: 11 (fol. 56v)
                           and 144: 10 (fol. 58r). There is no subdivision in psalm 143; psalm 118
                           is subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse units. There are textual divisions
                           at psalms 26, 52, 68, 80 and 109 (see ‘Decoration’). Originally there
                           were probably also historiated initials at the beginning of psalms 1, 38
                           and 97. Psalms are interspersed with full-page miniatures bound out of
                           order between the quires (see ‘Decoration’). </note>

                           miniatures, most likely the remains of three or four quires, are bound
                           out of order between the text quires of the present psalter. They are
                           similar in size to the rest of the psalter and may have been made for the
                           Hyde Breviary, or they may have been added at the time of the rebinding
                           in the 18th century or earlier (see Sandler, 1974, pp. 119–21 and
                           Sandler, 1986 for their probable original sequence). There is an offset
                           on fol. 35v of the illumination on fol. 38r which indicates that the
                           miniatures were not always in this position.</p>
                        <p>The miniatures appear to be by two artists (see Sandler, 1986, vol. 2,
                           no. 42 on the division of work) whose work has been identified in the
                           Peterborough Psalter (Brussels, Bibliothèque Royale MS. 9961–62) and the
                           Ramsey Psalter (St Paul im Lavanttal (Carinthia) Stiftsbibliothek MS.
                           XXV/2.19 and New York, Pierpont Morgan Library MS. M. 302) (Sandler,
                           1986, 1999). The miniatures are in rectangular frames, on gold
                           background, incised with geometric, floral and zoomorphic designs. </p>

                     1292–1304, successor of Robert de Popham (d. 1292), the last Hyde abbot whose
                     obit is written in the calendar in the original hand (see Tolhurst, 1932–42,

                  <provenance>The addition of the feasts of Grimbald (see ‘Text’) suggests that the

                     order, before the manuscript was acquired by Gough, and before 1755, since the
                     breviary, which has the same binding, was owned by Richard Rawlinson
                     (1690–1755). The order in which the quires are put together is indicated by
                     Arabic numerals (1–13) in a postmedieval, probably 18th-century, hand on fols.
                     2r, 4r, 10r, 12r, 22r, 24r, 36r, 38r, 49r, 51r, 61r, 63r and 71r. This
                     numbering shows that the Beatus-page was already lost when the volume was bound
                     (Sandler, 1974, p. 142 n. 69). </provenance>
