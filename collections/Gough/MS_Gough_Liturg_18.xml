                        <note>  Calendar for the use of Benedictine
                           Priory of St Mary and St Oswin, Tynemouth (Northumberland), 15th century,
                           laid out one month per leaf (see Wormald’s edition of the calendar of St
                           Albans, 1939, pp. 31–45). The calendar is graded to 12 lessons (in a
                           mixture of Arabic and Roman numerals), ‘in cappis’ and ‘in albis’,
                           approximately half full, and is written in brown and red with blue
                           initials, though the use of colour is partly decorative. The dedication
                           of the abbey church of St Albans, of which Tynemouth was a cell, is on 29
                           December (‘Dedicac(io) ecc(lesie) s(ancti) Albani’) with octave. St Alban
                           is on 22 June with octave; ‘inuentio sancti albani’ is on 2 August with
                           octave. The calendar also includes Amphibalus (25 June), venerated as a
                           priest who converted Alban to Christianity, and Benedict (11 July), both
                           with octaves. The deposition of Oswin, buried at Tynemouth, is on 20
                           August with octave, and his invention is on 11 March. Lupus of Troyes and
                           Germanus of Auxerre, commemorated because of their visit to St Albans in
                           446, are on 29 and 31 July. The calendar also includes Patrick (17
                           March), Guthlac of Croyland (11 April), the invention of Ivo (24 April),
                           the translation of Wulstan (6 June), Simeon of Jerusalem (18 February),
                           Basil (14 June) and the Feast of the Transfiguration (6 August) (see
                           Wormald, 1939, p. 33). The feast of relics, possibly an addition, is on
                           14 July (‘ffestum reliquia(rum)’). The feasts of Thomas Becket are
                           crossed out. The calendar is similar to that in Oxford, Bodleian Library
                           MS. Lat. liturg. g. 8 (see ‘Provenance’). </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, written as prose, without numbers, most preceded by a
                           rubric ‘psalmus david’ or ‘psalmus’. Punctuated throughout with punctus
                           used to mark the ends of verses, and punctus elevatus used to mark metrum
                           and minor pauses. One leaf is lost after fol. 25/6 (missing text psalms
                           25 and 26: 1–4). The psalms are in the biblical order; subdivisions
                           within psalms are not indicated, apart from 17: 26 (fol. 17r). Psalm 118
                           is subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse units. There are textual divisions
                           at psalms 38, 52, 68, 80, 97 and 109 (see ‘Decoration’). Originally there
                           was probably also an illuminated initial at the beginning of psalm 26,
                           now missing. On fol. 16v omitted verses are added in the lower margin in
                           an original or contemporary hand. </note>

                     had a special veneration for John the Baptist. A miniature shows a tonsured
                     cleric in a white habit, and the original arrangement of the miniatures quite
                     probably had fol. xiv verso facing fol. xvii recto. If the cleric was intended
                     to represent a Carthusian, he might have been a monk of either Hinton or
                     Witham, both of which were dedicated to the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, and
