                     <note>The text begins imperfectly towards the end of bk. 1 at the word 'sume'
                        (Miller 54/2). Bk. 2 begins on fol. 6r, bk. 3 on fol. 25 (the
                        <title>Interrogationes Augustini</title> (Miller 64-88) occupying 9 leaves, fols 58r-66v, at
                        the end of this book), bk. 4 on fol. 68r and bk. 5 on fol. 115v. Bk. 5 ends
                        imperfectly at the word 'unwillsumlice' (Miller 442/23).
                        Fol. 66v/18-27 and fol. 67r are blank. Fol. 2rv is missing, except for a small
                        fragment. Single leaves missing after fols 5, 19, 24, 26, 86. (cf. Miller 56/14-58/29, 92/17-96/8, 134/1-136/18, 150/20-152/22,
                        158/23-162/10, 304/7-306/19. A passage in bk. 3 (Miller 206-8/4) is omitted
                        as in CCCC 41. The scribe also omitted a long passage near the end
                        of bk. 4, passing from ‘þæs ylcan myn[stres abbodesse]' (Miller 358/30), the
                        closing words of fol. 104v, to [ðæs ilcan myn]stres abbod' (Miller 382/20),
                        the opening words of fol. 115r. Later, s. x med., the missing text was added
                        on ten leaves inserted after fol. 104r: it extended only to l. 19 on fol. 114v
                        and in order to make an exact join the 23 lines on fol. 115r were erased
                        (lines 24-29 were blank at the end of the book) and rewritten on fols
                        114v/19-115/21 in shorter lines. A continuous numeration of the chapters of
                        bks. 1 and 2 has been erased, but numbers running from XI to XVIII in bk. 1
                        and from IX to XXI in bk. 2 can be made out and appear to be contemporary.
                        The present chapter-numbers and the running titles were added in s. xiv and
                        Latin glosses (fols 1r-7r, 58v-60r) and notes are also of this date. The
                        name 'GODMÆR' is in the margin of fol. 83r. </note>

                        normal height, the join being achieved by making the headstrokes of g and t
                        with an upward slope: a is square in the ligature ea, but elsewhere more or
                        less rounded : the tall i is used in the word in: the three forms of s are
                        used, but long s is never used finally and round s is infrequent: y is
                        rounded and without dot: at a line-end the second stroke of n and h is often
                        prolonged downwards: descenders are long and tapering: abbreviations include
