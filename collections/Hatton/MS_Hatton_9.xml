                        <note> Sarum–Norwich calendar, written in black and red, laid out one month
                           per page, approximately three-quarters full, graded up to 9 lessons and
                           ‘festum principale’, with short instructions concerning the celebration
                           of feasts. The feasts include Felix of Dunwich (8 March) and the
                           dedication of Norwich Cathedral (24 September), both in red, David and
                           Chad (1 and 2 March), Benedict in red (21 March) and his translation in
                           black (11 July), John of Beverley (7 May), Anne in red (26 July),
                           Augustine in red (28 August), Winifred (3 November) and Leonard in red (6
                           November). The feasts marked as synodal (non-Sarum), all in red, are
                           Felix (8 March), the translation of Edward (29 April) and Francis (4
                           October). A verse on the ‘Egyptian’ days heads the page for January only
                           (‘Iani prima dies et septima a fine terminetur’). There are twelve added
                           obits from 1472 to 1480, several mentioning West Wycombe,
                           Buckinghamshire, and Rickmansworth (about 15 miles east of West Wycombe),
                           including ‘Obitus domini Thome Stheuenyssone vicarii iiijti de
                           westwycomb’ (10 January 1472) and ‘Obitus domini Iohannis Wynton vicarii
                           de Rykmynswurth’ (14 November 1480). Four obits are for women. The
                           dedication of the parish church of West Wycombe is added on 27 July.
                           There are also added feasts of Apollonia (8 February), Osyth (3 June),
                           whose shrine was at St Mary’s Church in Aylesbury, about 20 miles north
                           of West Wycombe, and Osmund (translation, 16 July, and deposition, 4
                           December). Osmund was canonized in 1457, and the feasts were probably
                           added around this time, possibly by the hand which added the obits,
                           writing more formally. The same hand also wrote the names of the months
                           in the lower margins (many very faded), followed by the number of days in
                           each month in Roman numerals. The feasts of Thomas Becket and the titles
                           ‘pape’ are crossed out. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, without titles or numbers, written as prose. Punctuated
                           throughout, with punctus used to mark the ends of verses and minor
                           pauses, and punctus elevatus used to mark metrum. Psalms are mostly in
                           the biblical order, but with some deviations, reflecting the order in
                           which they were recited in the secular use (see below). Subdivisions
                           within psalms are not indicated, apart from 118, subdivided into eleven
                           16-verse units in accordance with secular use. The psalms are accompanied
                           by chapters, antiphons and hymns with rubrics and musical notation. The
                           weekly canticles and Athanasian Creed appear at major liturgical
                           divisions: <list>
                              <item> (1) Confitebor tibi domine (Isaiah 12), fol. 28r, after psalm

                              <item> (7) Athanasian Creed (Quicumque uult ...), fol. 77v, after
                                 psalm 118, verse 32.</item>
                           </list> Psalm 113, fols. 70v–72r, is accompanied by musical notation, and
                           is followed by the opening lines of the hymn ‘Iam lucis orto sydere’
                           (Chevalier, no. 9272) with music for different days of the year. Psalms
                           114–116, read at Vespers on Monday in the secular use, follow psalm 118
                           on fols. 89r–v. This creates an unbroken sequence of all five psalms
                           appointed for Monday Vespers in secular use (psalms 114–116, 119–120).
                           Psalms 148–150, recited at Lauds on all days of the week in both monastic
                           and secular use, are written as a single text without breaks on fols.
                           100v–101r. Psalm 66 follows psalm 62 (fol. 39r). These two psalms were
                           also recited at all Lauds during the week in the secular use.</note>
                        <note> There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97 and
                           109 (see ‘Decoration’). Psalm 109 starts on a new page (the scribe left
                           four lines blank on the preceding page) and has a more prominent border
                           than other psalms at liturgical divisions. Some leaves have parchment
                           bookmarks sewn to their edges, made from a medieval manuscript written in
                           a formal Gothic style (the text is visible on bookmarks at fols. 55 and
                           97). The bookmarks indicate: <list>
                              <item>– the beginnings of the Penitential Psalms 31 (fol. 34r) and 101
                                 (fol. 97v);</item>

                                 Lauds (fol. 55r);</item>

                                 which follow psalm 118, deviating from the biblical order;</item>
                              <item> – canticle Benedicite omnia opera (fol. 103r);</item>
