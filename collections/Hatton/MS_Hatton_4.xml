                        <note> Sarum calendar, written in black and red, laid out one month per page
                           (see Scott, 1995, for a comparison of the Hatton calendar with the
                           version printed by Legg, 1916; see also MS. Hatton 45, another London
                           psalter). The calendar is not graded, apart from the use of colour. The
                           vigils are included only for the months June–December for Christmas, the
                           feasts of the apostles, the Virgin Mary and Lawrence (partly erased).
                           ‘Obitus Ric<ex>ard</ex>i Gregori yrmong<ex>er</ex>’ (4 September) is added by the
                           original scribe. The feasts of David and Chad (1 and 2 March),
                           promulgated in 1415, lack flourished capitals and appear to have been
                           added by the original scribe after the manuscript had been flourished
                           (Scott, 1995, pp. 104–5). This presumably happened soon after it was
                           written, and while it was still in the workshop. Guide-letters for the
                           initials are provided, and similar guide-letters written in red against
                           entries in red are visible under flourished capitals elsewhere in the
                           calendar (e.g. ‘Sancti gregorii’, 12 March; ‘Purificatio’, 2
                           February).</note>
                        <note> The feasts of David and Chad and the obit of Richard Gregory were
                           probably added at the same time: both are in a slightly larger script and
                           have capitals, decorated with double vertical strokes, at the beginning
                           of personal names, unlike other names in the calendar. The addition of
                           the feasts and the obit may have been part of a revision undertaken in
                           the workshop, soon after the manuscript was completed. The manuscript has
                           other corrections which appear to have been made in the original
                           workshop. The original red initial in the word Iniquos on fol. 84v, for
                           example, was erased and replaced by a blue initial with red penwork. The
                           added initial is by a different rubricator, possibly the first rubricator
                           of Hatton 4 (see Scott, 1995, p. 100, on the division of work among the
                           three flourishers of Hatton 4).</note>
                        <note> The feast (30 April) and the translation of Erkenwald (14 November),
                           bishop of London, as well as the translation of Nicholas (9 May), are
                           added in a 15th-century hand, presumably in London. Obits, entered in
                           15th-century hands, partially lost when the leaves were trimmed, perhaps
                           of parishioners of a church in London, include: hardy, twice (4 April),
                           Banest<ex>er</ex> (15 April), <unclear>I</unclear>oh<unclear>anne</unclear>m Mekol (17 April), sergan (23
                           April), dallyng (2 May), leuenthorp (27 May), [...]eman (12 August),
                           [...]lesabet (23 August), [...]lesabet scharburh wyfe (23 December). On
                           fol. 20r in the lower margin are Latin verses on prognostication by
                           thunder in a 15th-century hand, ‘Si tonitru<unclear>us</unclear> fuit in mense januarij
                           ventos validos ...’. The same hand added the feast of Antony of Egypt (17
                           January). The feasts of Thomas Becket and the titles ‘pape’ are erased.
                           The calendar includes 16th-century notes recording the births of the
                           children of Edward, 3rd Lord Windsor of Stanwell between 1559 and 1572
                           (printed by Scott, 1995). The months are headed by verses on the
                           ‘Egyptian’ days which correspond to Hennig’s (1955) set III. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150 in the biblical order, laid out with each verse starting
                           on a new line, in two columns, without numbers, with rubrics ‘p(salmu)s’.
                           Psalms 25: 1–27: 3 are missing because of the loss of one leaf after fol.
                           36. Punctuated throughout, with punctus used to mark the ends of verses
                           and minor pauses, and punctus elevatus used to mark metrum. Psalms are
                           accompanied by antiphons, versicles, invitatoria, etc., with short
                           rubrics referring to secular use. Subdivisions within psalms are not
                           indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into eleven 16-verse units.
                           Psalms 148–150 are written without a break as a single text. There are
                           textual divisions at psalms 38, 52, 68, 80, 97 and 109 (see
                           ‘Decoration’). Pages containing the beginnings of psalms 1 and 109 have
                           full borders. The text contains corrections in the hand which also
                           corrected the Office of the Virgin. Fragments of parchment bookmarks (or
                           of glue which used to hold them) mark the beginnings of the seven
                           Penitential Psalms: 6 (fol. 27r), 31 (fol. 38v), 37 (fol. 42v), 50 (fol.
                           48v), 101 (fol. 72r), 129 (fol. 88r), 142 (fol. 92r), and the beginning
                           of the litany (fol. 101v). Some psalm initials have been defaced by wet
                           smudging, possibly as a way of making them more noticeable.</note>
                        <note> The presentation of psalms in Hatton 4 has some similarities with MS.
                           Hatton 9, a secular choir psalter made in the second quarter of the 15th
                           century and used in a parish church in West Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, in
                           the third quarter of the 15th century. Hatton 9, like Hatton 4, has
                           parchment bookmarks marking some Penitential Psalms, and psalms 148–150,
                           a sequence for Lauds at all days of the week, written as a single text.

                           <note>Hatton 4 is the same height, but about 15 mm narrower than the
                              ‘Ellesmere Chaucer’ (Scott, 1995). The leaves are trimmed both
                              vertically and horizontally, causing the loss of some catchwords and
                              obits in the calendar. According to Scott, Hatton 4 is one of the
                              seven largest psalters to survive from the 15th century (1996, p. 107)

                  <provenance>Made for the use in choir in a secular church, as suggested by a large
                     size and the presence of antiphons, versicles, invitatoria, etc. with rubrics
                     referring to secular use. The London origin is suggested by a near contemporary
                     obit of Richard Gregory, a citizen of London, d. 1397 (Scott, 1995), though
                     unlike in MS. Hatton 45 there are no specifically London saints in the calendar
                     or litany. The church may have been St Lawrence Jewry (Lawrence is the only
                     non-biblical saint in the calendar given a vigil) or St Peter’s upon Cornhill
                     in London. Richard Gregory’s will specifies a bequest for interment in the
                     chapel of St Mary at St Peter’s and further bequests for improvements to the
                     church and to the chaplains (see Scott, 1995, p. 103). The rector of St Peter’s
                     upon Cornhill in the first quarter of the 15th century was John Whitby, named
                     as Richard Gregory’s executor on several documents. In a writ, dated 23 October
                     1397 (London, National Archives, C 131/213), he appears as Richard Gregory’s
                     executor with another chaplain, John atte Felde. In another writ, dated 28
                     March 1404 (London, National Archives, C 241/193), he appears as the executor
                     of Richard Gregory and administrator of his goods. In <title>A survey of the cities of
                     London and Westminster and the borough of Southwark</title> John Strype reports that
                     the church of St Peter upon Cornhill had a library and a prominent grammar
                     school (1754–55, vol. 1, p. 464) and that the books in the library were ‘viewed
                     and commended’ by John Leland. Leland mentions the library and, selectively,
                     its books in his <title>Collectanea</title> and <title>Itinerary</title>, but does not include any liturgical
                     books (see Hearne, 1774, iv, p. 48; Toulmin Smith, 1906–10, iv, pp. 54–5;
                     Harris, 2005). </provenance>
                  <provenance>15th-century addition of the feasts of St Erkenwald, patron of London,
                     to the calendar (‘Sancti Erkkynvaldi episcopi’, 30 April, and ‘transelacio
                     sancti Erkkynvaldi episcopi londoniensis’, 14 November) suggests that the
                     psalter continued to be used in the diocese of London. The obits in
                     15th-century hands in the calendar, the addition of the feasts and the presence
                     of corrections and notes comparing the text to the use of Sarum suggest a
                     continued use in a church, rather than private use. The obit ‘leuenthorp’ (27
                     May) is of John Leventhorpe (b. 1360), Receiver General of the Duchy of
                     Lancaster, who had an office in the city of London and died on 27 May 1435 (see
                     Kerr, 1935). His obit also appears on 27 May in the calendar of an early
                     15th-century missal, Cambridge, Trinity College MS. B. 11. 3, with other obits
                     of the Leventhorpe family (James, 1900–04). He is buried in Great Saint Mary’s
                     Church, Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire (<title>Monumental inscriptions</title>, 1989, p. 35). </provenance>
