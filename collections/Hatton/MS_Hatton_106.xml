                        <note> Calendar, similar to Sarum, with 15th-century Dominican entries, laid
                           out one month per page, written in red and black, graded up to 9 lessons,
                           approximately half full. Includes Teilio of Wales (‘Sancti theliay’) in
                           red (9 February). Anne (26 July) and Christopher (25 July) are added by
                           the original (?) scribe. Fifteenth-century additions include Thomas
                           Aquinas (7 March), Peter of Verona (29 April) and his translation (7
                           May), and Dominic (4 August). Ethelbert (19 May) is added in a
                           16thcentury (?) hand on fol. 4r. The feasts of Thomas Becket are erased.
                           The months are headed by verses on the ‘Egyptian’ days, which largely
                           correspond to Hennig’s (1955) sets I (June, October and November) and III
                           (the rest). </note>

                        <note> Psalms [1]–150, imperfect at the beginning, starting at 2: 5 (‘suo
                           conturbabit eos ...’), laid out as prose, without titles. The numbers of
                           psalms 3–56 and 128–138 are added in Roman numerals in the margins in a
                           late- or post-medieval hand. Punctuated throughout, with punctus elevatus
                           used to mark metrum, and punctus used to mark the ends of verses. Punctus
                           flexus is added to mark minor pauses in a medieval hand within the text
                           and in the margins (by the hand responsible for marginal additions on
                           fol. 20r (?), 15th century (?)). The psalms are in the biblical order,
                           accompanied by antiphons, versicles, responses, etc. The subdivisions
                           within the psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided
                           into eleven 16-verse units. There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38,
                           51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 109, 118 and 119 (see ‘Decoration’). The text
                           contains corrections in a contemporary hand, possibly by the main scribe
                           (e.g. fols. 124r, 139v, 150v, etc.) and antiphons added in the margins in
                           a late 15th-century hand (e.g. fol. 32r, 33r, 36r, 38v, 41r, etc.) with
                           crosses indicating their position in the text. </note>
