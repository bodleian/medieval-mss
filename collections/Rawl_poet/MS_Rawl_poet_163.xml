                     <note>M. C. Seymour places MS Rawl. poet. 163 in <q>Subgroup 2(a): altered states of text</q> category, with St John's College Cambridge, MS L.1 (<title>Catalogue of Chaucer Manuscripts</title>, 1995). Scribes contribute atypical marginal summaries in Middle English throughout the text, presented as glosses, and Latin glosses to Ovid, Statius, and notes to the <q>Auctor</q>. Also contains a unique stanza after Book II, line 1750. Blank space for one stanza is left on folio 26v without any textual omission.

The boards from the former binding are housed with the volume in a separate folder. These boards are the typical 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century Rawlinson binding of marbled paper boards with parchment spine lining and paper pastedown. The spine lining shows evidence of six raised sewing supports in the former binding. Six paper end leaves from this binding are still present in the manuscript. A note from Bruce Barker-Benfield on the final of these end leaves (foliated 119) records that <q>One further flyleaf of this late 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> cent. paper after 119 was removed and destroyed in the rebinding of 1985</q>. Barker-Benfield also conducted a collation survey of the manuscript after rebinding, now housed in the Bodley Refs, LVI.16. No other conservation records are preserved.</p> 
                     <p>The current binding (1985) comprises paper boards with external bevels covered in grey paper, with white leather spine lining. The spine shows four single raised sewing supports with projected spine tabs and sewn endbands in white thread. During the 1985 rebinding, paper sewing guards were added to the gutters of folios 9-10 and 21-22, and the gutters of folios 1-2, 5, were reinforced.</p>
                  <p>Parchment sewing supports are preserved on folios 14-15, 25-26, 37-38, 56-57, 64-65, 72-73, 80-81, 88-89, 101-102, and 109-110. These are made of recycled documentary material of the fifteenth century, which were formerly adhered to the paper folios. They likely pre-date the Bodleian and Rawlinson bindings, and are possibly contemporary to the production of the manuscript. </p></binding></bindingDesc>

                  <provenance>Several clues to the manuscript's origin can be found on the recycled parchment sewing guards, though fragmentary. The majority of fragments were cut from vertical strips with small portions of text running horizontally. The names <q>Rogerius</q>, <q>Ricardus</q>, <q>Johanus</q>, <q>Thomas</q>, <q>Simon</q> and <q>William</q> can be discerned, without legible surnames. Several of the parchment strips are cut from larger records, either manorial payment records or court rolls of fines, with columns of prices still visible. Comparable records can be found in Trinity College Cambridge, MS O.9.38 (item 5), the accounts of Glastonbury Abbey dated 1440-60; Christ Church Oxford, MS Archives xxix.b.13 (folios 4r-17r), the  accounts of the Priory of Daventry dated 1483-1492; and Dulwich Manor Court Rolls, Roll 10, record of tenants' paymento to the lord of the manor dated 1444. 
                     <p>Other fragments resemble legal documents or charters, which likely pertained to an estate that contained a mill or mill house as the word <q>molendin<ex>us</ex></q> can be seen in a strip of Latin text at folios 14-15. The sewing guard at folios 101-2 was cut from a horizontal strip with text running vertically, and contains several lines of Latin text that resembles a jury presentment about a road (<q>via</q>). The phrases <q>portam de Westgate</q> and <q>venellam <gap/> Medlane</q> suggest a connection to Westgate and Medlane in Canterbury. Grants from the 13th and 14th centuries in Canterbury Cathedral mention both places by name in a comparable format, e.g. CCA-DCc/ChAnt/M/1; CCA-DCc/ChAnt/C/1042B.</p></provenance>
                  <provenance>Due to the collaborative nature of the scribes' copying, the volume of other contemporary or near-contemporary hands in the margins, the quantity of paper stocks, and the nature of the recycled sewing guards, the manuscript was likely produced in a community of educated literary individuals working closely together, plausibly a religious institution or household that would have access to exemplars to copy and disposable documentary materials for binding.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The meaning of the collophon <q>Tregentil</q> on folios 113v and 114r is unclear. Skeat (1891) suggests it is the name of the scribe but this is speculative. On this debate, see Frese 1982, Brusendorff 1925, MacCracken 1908, and Skeat 1891.</provenance>
                  <provenance>A marginal note on folio 80v records <q><persName role="sgn" key="person_4857">Thomas Howlet</persName> Writ This in the yere of oure Lord god 1568</q>. The same hand records <q>Thomas Howlet</q> on folio 99r after the explicit to <title>Troilus</title>. Howlet may be identified as a descendent of the de Howlett family of Suffolk, possibly Thomas Howlett (d. 1619) whose will is recorded in TNA PROB 11/134/410.</provenance>
                  <provenance notAfter="1755" notBefore="1690" resp="#MMM">The manuscript was later owned by <persName key="person_1203" role="fmo">Thomas Rawlinson (1681–1725)</persName>. It is recorded in the inventory of Thomas Rawlinson's collection in BodL, MS Rawl. C. 937 as item 192.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript is not listed in the sale catalogue of Thomas Rawlinson's collections by Thomas Ballard in 1733–4, <title>Codicum Manuscriptoru, Bibliothecae Rawlinsonianae Catalogus; cum Appendice Impressorum; in omni fere Facultate et Lingua</title>. However, it must have been acquired by <persName key="person_47563478">Richard Rawlinson (1690–1755) after his brother's death in 1725.</persName></provenance>
                  <acquisition resp="#MMM" when="1755">The manuscript was bequeathed to the Bodleian in 1755 by Richard Rawlinson on his death.</acquisition>
