                           November). The calendar also contains Franciscan and Dominican saints:

                           October). Each month is headed by a note on the length of the solar and

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, written with each verse starting on a new line, without
                           titles or numbers. Imperfect at the end: the last verse of psalm 150 is
                           missing because of the loss of leaves after fol. 183. Punctuated
                           throughout, with punctus used to mark the ends of verses and colon used
                           to mark metrum. The psalms are in the biblical order; subdivisions within
                           psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into
                           twenty-two 8-verse units. There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38,
                           52, 68, 80, 97 and 109 (see ‘Decoration’). Psalm 39 starts without an
                           illuminated initial (fol. 57r). </note>
