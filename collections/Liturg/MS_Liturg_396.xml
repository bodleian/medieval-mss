                        <note> Calendar (published and compared with calendars of other psalters
                           from the Bruges–Ghent area by Carlvant, 1978, pp. 485–508), laid out one
                           month per page, approximately one-third full, not graded, vigils included
                           from June to December. The calendar contains Donatianus (14 October),
                           patron saint of an important parish and collegiate church in Bruges,
                           which in early modern times served as a cathedral of the archdiocese of
                           Bruges, and Boniface (5 June), patron of a church in Bruges. Other feasts
                           may indicate the patron’s connection with Ghent, particularly with the
                           Benedictine monastery of St Bavo: Benedict (21 March) and his translation
                           (11 July), Landoaldus (19 March), Macarius of Ghent (9 May, elevation)
                           and Bavo of Ghent (1 October; ‘bauonis’ is written in a slightly larger
                           script). The monastery preserved the relics of Landoaldus, Macarius and
                           Bavo. The last page of the calendar (December) is in a different, but
                           contemporary, hand, in paler brown ink. Unlike the rest of the calendar,
                           the November and December leaf is not pricked in the lower margin. Its
                           text in red and blue is in the same hand and the decoration is by the
                           same artist as elsewhere in the calendar. The December page may have been
                           copied from a different exemplar: it is fuller than other months and has
                           an octave of Andrew (7 December) (octaves are not included elsewhere).
                           December feasts include Eulalia (10), ‘Martus presbyter’ (15), Lazarus
                           (17), Rufus (18) and Victoria (23), the last rare in contemporary
                           calendars from Bruges and Ghent (see Carlvant, 1978, p. 507). The hand of
                           the December page also added octaves of Stephen, John the Evangelist and
                           the Holy Innocents in January, Bertin on 5 September, and vigils for some
                           feasts. ‘locus bisextus’ is added on 24 February (fol. 1v) in a
                           15th-century hand, followed by an explanation in Netherlandish: ‘locus
                           bissexti bissext es dat men heut tue daghe op de lettre van zente mathis
                           daghe ende bissext gheualt alse men de iare van ons heren ghebornessen
                           mach delen in viren eueneffene’ (‘bissext is that there are two days on
                           the letter of Saint Matthew’s day and bissext falls when the year of our
                           Lord’s birth can be divided equally into four parts’). There is another
                           note by the same hand in March, about the calculation of the date of
                           Easter: ‘Wi selen nemen de niuwe mane nar de nonen van marte ende tellen
                           tote . xiiii . ende derste zondach die comp nar die xiiii dat es
                           pacshdach’ (‘We must take the new moon after the Nones of March and count
                           to the 14th (day) and the first Sunday which comes after the 14th (day)
                           that is Easter day’). The letter ‘d’ marking the ‘Egyptian’ days is also
                           added in darker ink, possibly by the same 15th-century hand. The calendar
                           includes the ‘aparicio . s . marci euangieliste’ [sic] on 25 June, and
                           ‘vigilia’ for the feast of Peter and Paul (29 June) added in a
                           post-medieval, 16th-century (?), probably Italian hand (see
                           ‘Provenance’). </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, laid out with each verse starting on a new line,
                           without titles, with numbers added in the margins in a late medieval or
                           post-medieval hand. The psalms are in the biblical order; the
                           subdivisions within psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118,
                           subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse units. Psalms 17 and 73 follow the
                           preceding psalms without a break or larger initial (fols. 25v and 80r).
                           Punctuated throughout with punctus elevatus used to mark metrum and minor
                           pauses, and punctus used to mark the ends of verses. There are textual
                           divisions at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 101 and 109 marked by
                           historiated initials and usually by facing miniatures (see ‘Decoration’).
                           Verses 14–15 of psalm 113B are supplied in the original hand over erasure
                           on fol. 121r. Fol. 15v is occupied by the Beatus-initial and the opening
                           words of psalm 1; fol. 15r is blank. </note>

                        <note> Litany, published and compared with the litanies of other psalters
                           from the Bruges–Ghent area by Carlvant (1978, pp. 509–30), containing
                           saints venerated in Bruges, such as Donatianus and Basil, patron of the
                           chapel of St Basil and the Holy Blood in Bruges, among the confessors,
                           and Boniface among the martyrs. Also includes saints venerated in Ghent,
                           such as Landoaldus and Macarius among the confessors, and Amalberga,
                           Landrada and Pharaildis among the virgins. The relics of Landoaldus,
                           Macarius and Landrada were preserved at the Benedictine Abbey of St Bavo
                           in Ghent (Carlvant, 1978, p. 121). The litany is followed by unusual

                        <p> Red leather over wood boards, 15th century, Netherlandish. The covers

                           triangular, square and rectangular tools. The lozenges and some squares
                           contain fleurs-de-lis; one of the rectangles contains a dragon and
                           another lamb-and-flag. Rebacked at the Bodleian. Sewn on 7 cords, seven
                           raised bands on spine. Gilt lettering on spine: ‘MS. || MISC no. ELL.
                           LITURG. || 396.’. Paper label on spine printed ‘94’. Holes left by the

                           (see Foot, 1993)). The bottom edge of the textblock has the shelfmark
                           ‘396’, suggesting that the volume was formerly stored fore-edge down. The

                  <provenance>Probably made in Bruges in a workshop which produced other psalters
                     with similar illumination, textual contents and codicological features, and
                     flourished c. 1250–1270 (Carlvant’s ‘Eerste Groep’, 1978, pp. 2–12, 80–8).
                     Psalters are the only known books to come from this workshop. Probably made for
                     a lay patron, perhaps with connections in the Ghent area, since the calendar
                     and litany include saints venerated in Ghent, particularly in the Benedictine
