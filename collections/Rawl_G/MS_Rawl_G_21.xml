                        <note> Psalms 1–150, in the biblical order, written with each verse starting
                           on a new line, without titles. Subdivisions within psalms are not
                           indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided mostly into 16-verse units.
                           The beginning of two 8-verse units are marked with larger initials: Manus
                           tue (118: 73, fol. 121v) and Princeps persecuti (118: 161, fol. 126v).
                           Psalm numbers are added in the margins in black ink, in Arabic numerals,
                           in a 17th-century (?) hand, which also made notes in English about the
                           missing text on fols. 43r, 56v, 57r, 82r and 95r (see below). The same
                           hand numbered the 8-verse units in psalm 118. There is an offset from a
                           document with a formal Gothic writing, perhaps contemporary with the
                           manuscript and once present between its leaves, on fol. 40r. The
                           following text is missing: <list>
                              <item>– one leaf missing after fol. 42 (missing text 37: 14–38:

                              <item> – one leaf missing after fol. 111 (missing text 108: 21–109:
                                 4).</item>
                           </list> Punctuated throughout with punctus elevatus used to mark metrum,
                           punctus or punctus elevatus used to mark minor pauses, and punctus used
                           to mark the ends of verses. There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 68,
                           119 (the beginning of the Gradual Psalms) and 143 (one of the Penitential
                           Psalms) (see ‘Decoration’). Originally there were probably historiated
                           initials on leaves, now excised, containing the beginnings of psalms 38,
                           51 (?), 52, 80, 97 and 109. There are offsets of illuminated borders on
                           fols. 43r, 95r and 112r from leaves which used to face them and contained
                           the beginnings of psalms 38, 97 and 109. Many leaves are mutilated,
                           sometimes with a loss of text. </note>
