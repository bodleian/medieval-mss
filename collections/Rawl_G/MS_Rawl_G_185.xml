                        <note>Calendar for the use of the Augustinian canons of Christ Church,
                           Dublin, laid out one month per page, written in brown, blue, red, pink
                           and gold, graded to 9 lessons and ‘duplex festum’. Augustine of Hippo is
                           in gold (28 August) with octave and translation in red (11 October). Also
                           in gold are Patrick (17 March, ‘sancti patricii hibernie apostoli’),
                           Columba (9 June), Lawrence O’Toole (14 November, ‘sancti laurencii
                           archiepiscopi dublini’) and Catherine (25 November). The following saints
                           are in red or blue: David (1 March), Cuthbert (20 March), Dunstan (19
                           May), Augustine of Canterbury (26 May, ‘primi anglorum episcopi’),

                           (12 October). The calendar includes many other Irish saints, such as
                           Itha, patroness of Killeedy, Limerick (15 January), Fursey, abbot of
                           Langy near Paris (16 January), Aedhan, bishop of Ferns (31 January),
                           Brigid of Kildare (1 February), Fintan, abbot of Clonenagh (17 February),

                           March), Brendan (16 May), Kieran, abbot of Clonmacnoise (9 September),
                           Finbar McBindi (10 September), Canice (11 October) (for a full list of
                           Irish saints in the calendar and comparison with the calendar of another
                           Christ Church book, the Martyrology, see Hand, 1956, pp. 312–14). The
                           feast of relics is in red on 31 July. The elevation of the relics of
                           Edward, king and martyr, is added in a 16th-century hand at 20 June
                           (‘Translatio Sancti Edwardi’). The months are headed by verses on the
                           ‘Egyptian’ days, which correspond to Hennig’s (1955) set III, and end
                           with notes on the number of hours in days and nights, e.g. ‘Nox habet
                           horas xvi. dies uero viij.’ (January). In February ‘locus bisextus’ is
                           entered against the 24th with the Dominical letter ‘f’ and there are
                           Latin verses in red in the original hand in the lower margin: Si bisextus
                           erit f. seruetur utrique diei Posteriori die celebratur festum mathie.
                           Verses on psalms in red in the original hand on the page for December,
                           before the start of psalms (fol. ix verso): ‘Centum quingenos dauid canit
                           in ordine psalmos Uersus bis mille sex centum sex canit ille’ (Walther,
                           no. 19209).</note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, without titles or numbers, written with each verse
                           beginning on a new line. Punctuated throughout, with punctus used to mark
                           the ends of verses, and punctus elevatus used to mark metrum. The psalms
                           are in the biblical order; the subdivisions within psalms are not
                           indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into eleven 16-verse units.
                           Psalms 148–150 are written without breaks as a single text. The psalms
                           are accompanied by antiphons and versicles, with short rubrics and
                           musical notation (square notation on staves of three or four red lines).
                           There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38, 52, 68, 80, 97 and 109.
                           Roman numerals ii–vii (for days of the week) are written in the margins
                           next to the initials of psalms 26, 38, 52, 68, 80 and 97, possibly in the
                           original workshop. Psalm 109 starts at the beginning of a new quire and
                           the scribe left much of the preceding fol. 96v blank. The text contains
                           corrections, and omitted verses are added in margins in the original or a
                           contemporary hand. </note>

                           ‘Provenance’). The colophon is in the original hand in coloured inks,
                           changing at the start of every new line, alternating between pink, red
                           and blue: ‘ffrater Stephanus de Derby . Prior ecclesie sancte trinitatis

                           nine priors of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, added in a 16th-century
                           hand, headed by a rubric ‘Successores Steph. de Derby’, beginning with
