                        <note>Canon of the Mass; in the text of the Memento for the living are two interlinear additions; the text reads: 'Memento domine famulorum famularumque tuarum. et omnium circumastantium \omniumque fidelium/ quorum tibi fides cognita est. et nota deuotio \pro quibus tibi offerimus vel/ qui tibi offerunt hoc sacrificium ...'; the omission of these words in the original text indicates Cistercian Use (see Leroquais, <title>Sacramentaires et Missels</title>, I, xxiv); marginal additions of the 14th century are described and discussed under Provenance.</note>

(fol. 71r, col. 2), 'Verte .iio. folia' (fol. 71v, col. 1), etc.; in the Mass for Thomas Becket (29 Dec.) <locus>(fols. 69v-70v)</locus> the Collect, Secret and Post-communion have been erased, and re-written perhaps by more than one hand; they now read, respectively: 'Deus pro cuius ecclesia gloriosus pontifex thomas ...', 'Salutaris hostie munus sacrandum ...', and 'Adiuuet nos omnipotens deus et misericors ...' (cf. Marvin L. Colker, <title>Trinity College Library Dublin Descriptive Catalogue of the Medieval and Renaissance Latin Manuscripts</title> (2 vols., Aldershot, 1991), I, 628, MS. 312, items 47 and 49); to judge by the trace of a blue initial 'M', the Secret may previously have been 'Munera tibi domini ...', found in early Masses of St. Thomas; at the start of the feast of Sts. Fabian &amp; Sebastian (20 Jan.) is a red cross, keyed to an added instruction (fol. 70v, lower margin) for a Mass for St. William of Bourges (10 Jan.; canonized, and added to the Cistercian calendar in 1218; see Backaert, 85, 121; and D. F. L.

Ante thronum trinitatis miserorum miserator | Guillerme uas pietatis sis pro nobis exorator | causam nostre pauperitatis coram deo sustine et | ueniam de peccatis seruis tuis optine [sic] -'; below the Mass for St. Ambrose (4 Apr.) is an added instruction (fol. 77v, lower margin) for a Mass for St. George (23 Apr.): 'De sancto Georgio quere unius confessoris', no proper Mass being given for him; inserted before the rubric <locus>(fol. 80r)</locus> for the Cistercian St. Peter of Tarentaise (10 May; canonized and added to the Cistercian calendar, in 1191) is a caret mark and signe de renvoie with a marginal rubric, '<hi rend="italic">De sancto iohanne ante portam latine.</hi>' (6 May), for which Text 14 was added <locus>(fol. 130r)</locus>; before the rubric for the Sts. Peter &amp; Paul (29 June) is a marginal rubric <locus>(fol. 81v)</locus>, partly cropped in re-binding, referring to a Mass for Sts. John &amp; Paul (26 June; feast raised to 12 lessons in the Cistercian calendar in 1218; see Backaert, 306, 121): '<hi rend="italic">[I]ohannis et pauli | [q]uere totum in | [fi]nem libri.</hi>', but no such text now survives at the end of the volume; below the Mass for St. Stephen (2 Aug.) is added an instruction for the Mass of the Crown of Thorns (11 Aug.): '<hi rend="italic">In sollempnitate sancte corone. quere in principio libri et inuenies.</hi>' (fol. 85v, lower margin) referring to the text on fol. 3r-v; the post-1202 Mass of St. Bernard (20 Aug.) (fol. 87r, rubric on fol. 87v) (cf. Chadd, at 310 n. 64); near the end of the Mass for St. Luke (18 Oct.) is a rubric (fol. 94v, outer margin) for the Mass for Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins (21 Oct.): '<hi rend="italic">Festo vndecin milium virginum | [qu]ere in principio libri.</hi>', refering to the text on fol. 3r; next to the Mass for All Saints (1 Nov.) is a rubric (fol. 95r, outer margin) for the Eve of All Saints (31 Oct.): '<hi rend="italic">vigilia omnium sanctorum. Quere in fi[ne] libri.</hi>', refering to the text on fols. 128v-129r; above the Mass for St. Cecilia (22 Nov.) is a rubric (fol. 96r, upper margin) for the Mass of St. Edmund (20 Nov.): '<hi rend="italic">In natali sancti edmundi episcopi et confessor. Quere in fine libri.</hi>' (keyed with a signe de renvoie), refering to the text on fol. 129r-v; next to the start of the Mass for St. Andrew (30 Nov.) is a rubric in large script (fol. 96v, lower margin) for the Mass of St. Katherine (25 Nov.; feast raised to 12 lessons in the Cistercian calendar in 1214; see Backaert, 113, 121): '<hi rend="italic">Katerine uirginis. totum sicut de sancta lucia. verte folium.</hi>' (keyed with large red crosses); next to the Post-communion for St. Andrew is an added note (fol. 97r, outer margin) for the Mass of St. Eloi (1 Dec.; feast raised to 12 lessons and 2 masses in 1287; see Backaert, 121): 'De sancto Eligio. Fiat Sicut De sancto Nichola[o]', the Mass for Nicholas (6 Dec.) begins a few lines lower down the same column.</note>

                        <p>One 8-line (?) painted (?) initial, excised during the medieval period, now replaced by a later (probably post-medieval) substitute. The amount of space left by the scribe indicates that the original initial was probably eight lines high. This was excised, leaving an irregular hole 63–5 × 57–8 mm. The hole was patched on the recto with a somewhat ragged-edged piece of parchment 74–6 × 64–5 mm., and on both recto and verso of this was written, in a 15th-century (?) gothic bookhand, the text that had been excised. Backlighting suggests that a large letter 'T' was also supplied to replace the lost original, but this has now been covered by a second piece of parchment, 61–2 × 59–60 mm., on which is painted an initial in imitation of the two originals which survive on the page. <locus>(fol. 65r)</locus> Canon of the Mass.

                        <p>Bound in 19th-century parchment over pasteboards, with a blind-tooled double fillet around the edges of each cover; brown modern paper pastedowns and conjoint flyleaves, the flyleaves with the watermark 'BATH | 1824' suggesting a terminus post quem and possible place of binding; the spine inscribed in brown ink 'XX[V (see below)] | Missale Gal-|licanum. | XII. Cent.', the last line gone over in darker ink. Fols. 1r-2r show ferrous stains, presumably caused by metal fittngs of a previous binding, at the fore-edge, approx 60–80 mm. from the top and bottom of the page. Talbot states that Pontigny books were usually bound in thick wooden boards, which often split due to the manner of nailing studs into each cover (Talbot (see provenance), 110–11). During the 1820s there was a duty to be paid, by weight, on the import of all manuscripts written before 1801; the duty for bound books being higher than for unbound ones (see A. N. L. Munby, <title>Phillipps Studies</title>, III (Cambridge, 1954), 33), and it is therefore quite possible that Allard (see under Provenance) might have removed any heavy binding of no apparent interest, and then had the volume rebound inexpensively once in England.</p>

                  <provenance>Probably made for, and perhaps at, the Cistercian abbey of <orgName key="org_135387394" role="fmo">Notre-Dame, Pontigny</orgName> (Yonne, France), probably between 1203 and 1214: the manuscript is clearly Cistercian (see under Contents, Script, Decoration), and has strong evidence for having been at Pontigny from c. 1300 until the suppression of the house in the late 18th century (see below); the latest datable original feast in the Sanctorale is St. Barnabas (11 June) whose feast was raised to 12 lessons in the Cistercian calendar in 1203 (see Backaert, 304, 121) and the earliest datable feast omitted from the original Sanctorale is St. Katherine (25 Nov.) whose feast was raised to 12 lessons in the Cistercian calendar in 1214 (Backaert, 113, 121). On the library of the abbey, see especially Talbot, 1954; see also Anne Bondeelle-Souchier, <title>Bibliothèques cisterciennes dans la France médiévale. Répertoire des Abbayes d'hommes</title> (Paris, 1991), 261–2; and A.-M. Genevois, J.-F. Genest, A. Chalandon (eds.), <title>Bibliothèques de manuscrits médiévaux en France. Relevé des inventaires du VIIe au XVIIIe siècle</title> (Paris, 1987), 192–3.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The volume was presumably still at Pontigny during the 13th and 14th centuries: new Cistercian feasts were added during the 13th century, and in the early 14th century additions were made in the Canon, and elsewhere: in the prayer for the pope, bishop, king, etc., after the Te igitur, next to the reference to '... et rege nostro. ill. ...' (fol. 65v), has been added in the margin 'domini regis francie' in a 14th-century cursive hand; below this, next to the Memento for the living, have been added 'domini Edwardi' (perhaps over an erasure), in a different 14th-cent cursive hand, immediately below this is, in darker ink, 'Regis an-|glie', presumably referring to Edward I (d. 1307); below this another similar hand has written 'margarete | de clere comitissa | cornubie' (i.e. Margret de Clare, d. 1313); next to the Memento for the dead (fol. 66v, col. 1) has been added in the margin '[E]dmundi comitis | [c]ornubie', in another 14th-cent cursive hand, which must refer to Edmund Plantagenet (d. 1300), Margaret's husband, and Regent for Edward I, in 1286–9; below this is an erasure (of a name?) written in larger script, in brown ink, and below this 'Domini Roberti | cardinalis' and 'Adele Regine' in yet another 14th-century cursive hand, in greyish ink: the former must be Robert Kilwardby (d. 1278), Archbishop of Canterbury, and the latter is presumably Adèle of Champagne (d. 1206), wife of Louis VII, who was a benefactor of Pontigny, and buried before the high altar; in the margins alongside the Mass 'Pro fratribus congregationis', a 13th-14th-century hand has twice added 'et benefactores' (fol. 124v).</provenance>
                  <provenance>In the inventory of the Pontigny library drawn up in 1675 by Charles de Tonnellier (pr. Talbot, 112–17, at 112), two missals are mentioned; the more detailed inventory drawn up by Jean Depaquy in 1778 lists nine (pr. Talbot, 127–42, at 139); Pontigny was suppressed in 1789, and the inventory drawn up in 1794 by the commissioners of the Republic lists seven, of which two (pr. Talbot, 143–54, at p. 152, numbers 12 and 23) are described as 13th-century folio volumes, either of which may perhaps refer to the present manuscript. The movement of the Pontigny manuscripts first to Sens, later to Auxerre, from 1790 to 1824, is described by Talbot, 155–7.</provenance>
                  <provenance>Inscribed with the inventory number '151' in the middle of the top margin of fols. 2r and 4r, corresponding to the inventory drawn up in c. 1791 by Père Laire (now Besançon, Bibliothèque municipale, ms. 1262, fols. 49–72v). (London, BL, Add. MSS. 26761 and 26762 have the erased numbers '21' and '24', respectively, in the equivalent position; others are reproduced in plates accompanying Sotheby's, 10 July 1972, lot 32, and Quaritch, Cat., 1931.</provenance>

MSS. 26761, 26762), the word 'Romain' subsequently effaced, and 'Gallican' written alongside in pencil by another hand; inscribed in pencil 'No 18' in the top left corner. Allard seems to have brought a number of manuscripts from the house to England between 1824 and 1828 (Talbot, 157)—the former date corresponds with the watermark of the flyleaves—possibly through the agency of a Parisian paper merchant, a certain Longhaie or Longuet (Munby, <title>Phillipps Studies</title>, III, 22 n. 1).The flyleaves suggest that the binding is English, but the spine-title looks continental: it is therefore possible that Allard brought the volume to England unbound, and supplied the spine title after binding; inscribed 'Codex XXV' in the upper centre of fol. i recto under the pasted-in description of the manuscript (visible only with strong back-lighting), cf. the spine inscription, under Binding. Inscribed in pencil 'perfect' bottom left corner, fol. 1r (as, similarly, in other Pontigny-Allard manuscripts, including London, BL, Add.
