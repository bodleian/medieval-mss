                        <note> Calendar (published by Temple, 1985, pp. 36–8), laid out one month
                           per page, approximately half full, not graded. The calendar is written
                           alternately in red, green and blue, used decoratively, rather than for
                           the grading of feasts. Vigils are included from June to December. The
                           calendar contains many Flemish saints and largely corresponds to the
                           calendar of Bruges (Temple, 1985). Among the saints particularly
                           venerated in Bruges are Donatianus (14 October), titular saint of the
                           parish and collegiate church in Bruges, which served as a cathedral in
                           early modern times, and Basil (14 June), patron of the chapel of St Basil
                           and the Holy Blood in Bruges. The calendar contains other saints
                           venerated in the Bruges–Ghent region, such as Amand and Vedast (6
                           February), Ansbertus (9 February) and Macarius of Ghent (Antioch) (9
                           May). The Feast of the Transfiguration is on 26 July (according to
                           Temple, 1985, p. 13, the celebration of this feast on this uncommon date
                           is found in only three other 12th- and 13th-century English calendars,
                           London, British Library, Cotton MS. Tiberius E. IV; Durham, University
                           Library MS. Sel. 6; and Oxford, Bodleian Library MS. Douce 270, all
                           produced for private patrons in the north of England and the Scottish
                           borderland). The calendar also contains several English saints,
                           particularly those venerated in the north of England, such as Wilfrid (24
                           April), John of Beverley (7 May), Paulinus (31 August) and Oswald (5
                           August). Cuthbert is commemorated twice (20 March and 4 September);
                           Kentigern of Glasgow is on 13 January. The calendar also includes Alban
                           (22 June), Edmund (20 November) and Swithin (2 July). The absence of
                           Thomas Becket suggests a date before his canonization in 1173. Botulph
                           and Etheldreda (17 and 23 June) are added in a contemporary hand. The
                           titles ‘papae’ are erased and replaced with ‘episcopi’ in a 16th-century
                           (?) hand. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, without titles or numbers, written with each verse
                           starting on a new line. The colour of ink changes with each line (see
                           ‘Physical description’ (‘Script’)). Punctuated throughout with punctus
                           elevatus used to mark metrum, and punctus used to mark the ends of verses
                           and minor pauses. The psalms are in the biblical order; the subdivisions
                           within the psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided
                           into eleven 16-verse units. The unit beginning with ‘Iniquos’ (118: 113)
                           is further subdivided into two 8-verse units (‘Feci iudicium’, 118: 121,
                           begins with a 3-line initial). Fol. 16r is occupied by a full-page
                           Beatus-initial, but the first verse was never filled in (psalm 1 starts
                           on fol. 16v with verse 2, ‘Sed in lege ...’). Many other omitted verses
                           are added between the lines and in the margins in a contemporary hand
                           (e.g. fols. 69r, 123v). Various errors are corrected throughout, probably
                           in the same hand (e.g. substitution on fol. 71r, erasures on fols. 71v
                           and 72r, etc.). Psalms 89–91 are omitted and there is a drypoint note in
                           a 13th-century hand pointing this out in the lower margin on fol. 84r.
                           These psalms are added on fols. 137v–139v in a contemporary hand which
                           corrected the psalter. Psalms 148–150 are written as a single text,
                           though the initial ‘L’ at the beginning of psalm 150 (fol. 125v) is
                           indented, unlike other initials at the beginning of verses. There are
                           textual divisions at psalms 21, 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 109, 114,
                           121, 126, 131, 137 and 143 (see ‘Decoration’). The initials mark psalms
                           appointed to be read first at Matins during the week in the secular use
                           and, unusually, psalms appointed to be read first at Vespers during the
                           week in the secular use (psalms 114, 121, 126, 131, 137 and 143). Psalm
                           51 is marked with an illuminated initial as is common in psalters from
                           England and the Netherlands (see Carlvant, 1978, pp. 457–72). Psalm 21
                           was also sometimes marked with an illuminated initial in psalters from
                           the Bruges–Ghent region, though this is found in later, 13th- and
                           14th-century psalters, such as MSS. Douce 5–6 (see Carlvant, 1985, p.
                           332, n. 21). </note>

                        <note> Litany (published by Temple, 1985, p. 18), based on a Continental,
                           northern French (?) model, rather than a litany from Bruges or Ghent. It
                           includes Martial (last) among the apostles; Martin (first), Audomar,
                           Bertin, Remigius, Vedast, Amand and Eligius among the confessors;
                           Benedicta and Eusebia (last) among the virgins. The litany also includes
                           insular saints: Oswald (in third place), Alban and Edmund (last) among
                           the martyrs; Cuthbert (fourth) among the confessors; Brigid (of Kildare
                           (?)) among the virgins. Followed by invocations (not a normal English
                           series) and two collects (fol. 137r): <list>

                        Gloucester as another example of a psalter with colour used
                        decoratively in the calendar, and interprets it as an artistic
                        development within the context of the Anglo- Saxon tradition of

                     <decoNote type="miniature">Prefatory miniatures have English iconographical subjects, but the
                        artist may have also used a Continental model of the 11th century
                        (Kauffmann, 1975; Temple, 1984). Some iconography is untraditional, e.g. the
                        angel holding a book in the Annunciation scene.
                     The miniature cycle is related to the cycles in two other northern

                  <provenance>Written in the north of England and modelled on both English and
                     Continental exemplars: evidence of the calendar, litany and decoration (Temple,
                     1971, 1984, 1985). Produced in a well-organized scriptorium which had access to
                     multiple exemplars and where the scribes’ work was checked and corrected.
                     Probably made for a lay person: the calendar does not represent a liturgical
                     use of any house or diocese, and the litany does not agree with the calendar;
                     decorative approach to the presentation of the text and the calendar; psalms
                     are subdivided according to the secular use. The manuscript is related to two
                     other luxury psalters, the Hunterian Psalter (Glasgow, University Library MS.
                     Hunter U. 3. 2) and the Copenhagen Psalter (Copenhagen, Kongelige Bibliotek MS.
                     Thott 143 2o) (Kauffmann, 1975; Temple, 1984). All three psalters were produced
                     around the same time (Thomas Becket is missing from all three calendars),
                     probably in the north of England. The calendars and litanies are not identical,
                     but similar, and all include saints venerated in the north, such as Cuthbert,
                     Wilfrid, John of Beverley, Paulinus and Oswald. Most of the initials in the
                     Hunterian Psalter are by an artist responsible for some of the initials in the
                     Copenhagen Psalter. The iconography of the principal initials is similar in the
                     Hunterian and Copenhagen psalters, whereas the miniature cycle in Douce 293 is
                     related to that of the Hunterian Psalter. Temple (1985) compares MS. Douce 293
                     with London, British Library, Cotton MS. Tiberius E. IV from Winchcombe Abbey
                     near Gloucester (Worcester diocese). It shares with Douce 293 the decorative
                     use of colour in the calendar, the unusual date for the Feast of the
                     Transfiguration and the presence of northern saints in the calendar, introduced
                     when Worcester and York had the same bishop (972–1010 and again at intervals up
                     to 1062). </provenance>
