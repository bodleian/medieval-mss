                        <note> Calendar, laid out one month per page, major feasts in red,
                           approximately one-third full, not graded, badly faded (the text in red is
                           often unreadable). Includes Martin (11 November, in red) with octave and
                           his translation (4 July), Nicholas (6 December, in red) and his
                           translation (9 May), Eligius, bishop of Tournai (1 December) and his
                           translation (25 June), Basil, patron of the chapel of St Basil and the
                           Holy Blood in Bruges (14 June), Egidius (1 September), Bertin, abbot of
                           St-Omer (5 September), Audomar bishop of Thérouanne (9 September),
                           Lambert, bishop of Liège (17 September), Clare (11 August) and Francis (4
                           October). Thomas Becket is added in a 14th-century hand (29 December),
                           probably over the same feast in red. Each page is headed with a note on
                           the length of the solar and lunar month. Titles ‘pape’ apparently
                           smudged. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, written with each verse starting on a new line, without
                           titles or numbers. Fol. 7v contains a full-page Beatus-initial; fol. 7r
                           is blank. The psalms are in the biblical order; subdivisions within
                           psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into
                           twenty-two 8-verse units. A wrong initial (L instead of C) appears at the
                           beginning of psalm 149 (fol. 209v), presumably because the artist misread
                           ‘[ ]antate’ as ‘[ ]audate’. Punctuated throughout with punctus elevatus
                           used to mark metrum, and punctus used to mark the ends of verses and
                           minor pauses. There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52, 68,
                           80, 97, 101 and 109. A note in Netherlandish, ‘Dit siemen ouer de ziele’
                           (‘One should see this for the benefit of the soul’ or possibly ‘This one
                           may see/read about the soul’), is added in a 14th-century hand in the
                           lower margins of fol. 41v and fol. 185v (erased), next to the beginnings
                           of psalms 30 and 122. ‘Beatus vir’ is added in the upper margin on fol.
                           8r in a 16th-century English (?) hand. The text erased in the upper
                           margin on fols. 8v–35v was ‘psalmus’ followed by a number in Roman
                           numerals. Spillage of dark liquid, possibly ink, on fols. 97v–98r,
                           140v–141r. Discoloration suggesting exposure to damp and resulting mould,
                           especially at both ends. </note>
