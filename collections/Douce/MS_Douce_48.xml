                           <note> Franciscan calendar, laid out one month per leaf, written in red,
                              blue and black, approximately half full, graded to 9 lessons.
                              Franciscan saints in red including Francis (‘Natalis sancti francisci
                              confessori de ordine fratrum minorum’, 4 October) with octave; the
                              translation of Francis (‘festum duplex’, 25 May); and Anthony of Padua
                              (‘Natalis sancti antonii confessori de ordine fratrum minorum’, 13
                              June) with octave. The presence of Elizabeth of Hungary (17 November)
                              suggests a date for the production of the psalter after her
                              canonization in 1235, and certainly after her death in 1231. The
                              absence of Clare of Assisi suggests a date before her canonization in
                              1255 and perhaps before her death in 1253. The calendar also includes
                              Gilbert of Sempringham (4 February), Dominic (5 August), Cerbonius (10
                              October) and Vivianus (2 December). Each leaf is headed with a note on
                              the length of the solar and lunar month. The calendar contains the
                              following additions in a 14th-century (?) hand: Dorothy (6 February),
                              ‘decem milium martyrum’ (22 June), ‘divisio apostolorum’, ‘xi millia
                              virginum’ (21 October) and ‘Conceptio beate marie’ (8 December).
                              Crosses, added in black ink, mark various dates throughout the
                              calendar. </note>

                           <note> Psalms 1–150, written with each verse starting on a new line,
                              without titles or numbers. Punctuated throughout, with punctus used to
                              mark the ends of verses, punctus elevatus used to mark metrum, and
                              punctus or punctus elevatus used to mark minor pauses. The psalms are
                              in the biblical order; the subdivisions within psalms are not
                              indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse
                              units. There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80,
                              97, 109 and 143. Verse 4 of psalm 97 is marked with a larger initial
                              (‘Iubilate deo ...’, fol. 121v). Fol. 138r contains the last verse
                              of psalm 108; the rest of the page and fol. 138v are left blank, with
                              psalm 109 starting on a new leaf (fol. 139r). Psalms 149 and 150 are
                              written as a single text without a break (fol. 172v). </note>

                           <note> Litany, imperfect at the end. The leaves are bound out of order:
                              fol. 189 should follow fol. 190. One or two leaves, which may have
                              originally contained the collects, are missing at the end. The litany
                              is not obviously Franciscan, but contains saints venerated in northern
                              France: Maurilius (of Rouen (?)) is the first among the confessors,
                              and others include Clarus (of Nantes (?)), Lupus (of Troyes or Sens
                              (?)), Samson (of Dol (?)), Julian (of Le Mans (?)), Albinus (of Angers
                              (?)), Paternus (of Avranches (?)), Florentius (of Bonnet (?)) and
