                        <note> Psalms 1–150, written with each verse starting on a new line, without
                           titles. Punctuated throughout with punctus elevatus used to mark metrum
                           and punctus used to mark the ends of verses. The psalms are in the
                           biblical order and there are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52,
                           68, 80, 97, 101, 109 and 119. Psalm 109 is preceded by a miniature and
                           starts on a new leaf. Subdivisions within psalms are not marked with
                           larger initials, though some are marked with ‘Gloria’ (fols. 23v, 30r,
                           88v, 132v). Psalm 118 is subdivided into twenty 8-verse units and two
                           16-verse units (the beginnings of sections starting with verses 137
                           (Justus es domine ...) and 153 (Vide humilitatem ...) are not marked
                           with larger initials). Added marginal annotations occur next to most
                           psalm initials, including ‘m[atins?]’, ‘l[auds?]’, ‘p[rime?]’, ‘iii’ and
                           ‘t[erce?]’, ‘6’, ‘v[espers?]’, ‘c[ompline?]’, etc. Psalm numbers are
                           added in the margins by William Bendlowes, who also added his initials,
                           crosses, brackets and many notes (most erased) in the margins (see
                           ‘Provenance’).</note>

                        <note>On fol. 119r there is a prayer commending the souls of the dead,

                     <summary>According to Sandler (1986) the decoration is by three artists, one
                        responsible for the historiated initials at psalms 26, 38, 51, 52, 68 and
                        80, another responsible for marginal scenes at the above psalms and psalm
                        97, and the third responsible for the miniatures, initials and borders at
                        psalms 1 and 109, initials at psalms 97 and 101, and initials and borders at
                        psalm 119 and the beginning of the canticles. Dennison (1986) identifies two
                        artists: Hand A of the Vienna Psalter (corresponds to Sandler’s third
                        artist) and a second illuminator. The style of illumination is related to
                        the style of a group of artists who worked for patrons mostly in the diocese
                        of Ely. Close parallels include the Douai (Douai, Bibliothèque municipale
                        MS. 171) and St-Omer (London, British Library, Yates-Thompson MS. 14 (Add.
                        39810)) psalters and sections of the Luttrell (London, British Library, Add.
                        MS. 42130) and Ormesby (Oxford, Bodleian Library MS. Douce 366) psalters
                        (see Dennison, 1986, for further comparisons, the list of manuscripts she
                        identifies as the work of Hand A and the chronology of his work).

                  <provenance>Made in East Anglia in the early 1340s (?). The surround of a
                     historiated initial (fol. 110r) has the quartering of the arms of England and
                     France, with France in the dexter, which was adopted by Edward III for his arms
                     after 1340 (Pinches and Pinches, 1974, pp. 50–1 and Michael, 1994). A
                     decorative use of the arms of England and France for border surrounds, however,
                     is found already in the first half of the 14th century (Michael, 1994).
                     Dennison (1986) suggests Cambridge as the most likely centre of activity of the
                     artists who worked on the psalter and dates it on stylistic and other grounds
                     to c. 1340–43. A male patron (?) kneeling before the Virgin and Child in the
                     initial of psalm 119 (fol. 110r) bears damaged arms on his surcoat, which have
                     been identified as the arms of Montreuil (Pächt and Alexander, 1966–73), of
                     England and France (Alexander, 1983) and of England impaling Bohun (Michael,
                     1994). The psalter may have been commissioned for presentation to a nunnery
                     (initial on fol. 126r). </provenance>
