                        <note> Calendar (published and compared with the calendars of other psalters
                           from the Bruges–Ghent area by Carlvant, 1978, pp. 485–508), laid out one
                           month per page, written in red and brown, approximately one-third full,
                           not graded. Contains Donatianus in red (14 October), patron saint of an
                           important parish and collegiate church in Bruges, which served in early
                           modern times as cathedral of the archdiocese of Bruges, Boniface (5
                           June), patron of a church in Bruges (see Carlvant, 1978, pp. 122–6),
                           Egidius in red (1 September), Lambert, bishop of Liège in red (17
                           September), Remigius, Germanus, Vedast and Bavo of Ghent in red (1
                           October), Leodegar of Autun (2 October), Leonard of Limousin (6
                           November), Eligius in red (1 December) and Nicholas in red (6 December).
                           ‘Thomas e c’ (?) is added in a 14th-century English hand on 18 August and
                           ‘Thomas Jonet’ (?) on 21 November. Months are headed by verses on the
                           ‘Egyptian’ days and notes on the length of the solar and lunar month,
                           e.g. ‘Ianuarius habet dies xxxi luna xxx’. Most verses correspond to
                           Hennig’s (1955) set III, apart from the verses for January and
                           August–October, which roughly correspond to set I (‘Iani prima dies et
                           septima fine timetur’, etc.). There is no verse for June. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, laid out with most verses starting on a new line,
                           without titles. The numbers of psalms 1–10 are added in the margins; and
                           at psalms 6 and 9 there is a note ‘morning prayer’ (fols. 13v, erased,
                           and 16v), probably in the same, later 16th- or 17th-century hand. The
                           numbers of psalms beginning with historiated initials are added in pencil
                           by Douce. Punctuated throughout with punctus elevatus used to mark metrum
                           and minor pauses, and punctus used to mark the ends of verses. The psalms
                           are in the biblical order, subdivisions within psalms are not indicated,
                           apart from psalm 118, subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse units. Psalm 21
                           ends imperfectly at verse 22, and the opening words of psalm 22 are
                           missing, because of the loss of one leaf after fol. 33 (note ‘deficit
                           folio’ is written on fol. 33v in a 14th-century (?) hand, contemporary
                           and possibly the same as that of the ‘Thomas’ additions in the calendar).
                           Psalm 52 is missing because of the loss of leaves after fol. 77. The text
                           contains corrections in medieval hands. Errors are marked with crosses in
                           the margins, and cancelled by striking through or erasure or left
                           uncorrected. There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38, 68, 80, 97 and
                           109, marked with historiated initials and facing miniatures (see
                           ‘Decoration’). Psalm 52 originally also started with a historiated
                           initial and was preceded by a miniature (see ‘Physical description’
                           (‘Collation’)). </note>

                        <note> Litany, containing saints venerated in the Bruges–Ghent region
                           (published and compared with litanies of other psalters from this area by
                           Carlvant, 1978, pp. 509–12). Donatianus is the first among the
                           confessors, followed by Basil, who appears again towards the end of the
                           list of confessors. The litany also contains Leodegar and Julian (twice)
                           among the martyrs; and Macarius, Audomar, Medard, Eligius and Egidius
                           among the confessors. Followed by collects (fols. 232r–233r), including
                           one to St Nicholas (‘Deus qui beatum ...’): <list>

                     <decoNote type="miniature">Full-page miniatures on gold backgrounds (flaking)
                        in architectural frames and historiated initials, occupying most of the
                        page, at liturgical divisions. The prefatory miniature cycle is probably
                        incomplete. Miniatures preceding psalms 26, 52 and 109, and the text page
                        containing the beginning of psalm 52, have been excised (see ‘Physical
                        description’ (‘Collation’)). Prefatory miniatures and a miniature on a
                        single leaf (fol. 142) are painted on the versos, leaving rectos blank (see
                        Carlvant, 1985, p. 329 n. 14). Other miniatures, painted on leaves forming
                        parts of the ten-leaf gatherings, are on the versos with the psalter text on
                        the rectos. The miniatures and initials are on gold backgrounds (flaking) in
                        rectangular frames. <list>

                  <provenance>Made for the use of Bruges: evidence of the calendar and litany. The
                     simplicity of the textual contents and the absence of grading in the calendar
                     suggest a lay patron. St Nicholas appears in the litany and in red in the
                     calendar. The litany is followed by a collect to St Nicholas (compare MS. Douce
                     49). Carlvant notes that several psalters from the Bruges–Ghent area, probably
                     made for lay patrons, include images and prayers to St Nicholas of Myra (1978,
                     pp. 338–9). The psalter has many similarities in codicology, illumination and
                     textual contents with other contemporary psalters from the Bruges–Ghent area,
                     such as MS. Auct. D. 4. 2 (‘Tweede Groep’, Carlvant, 1978, pp. 140–57). </provenance>
