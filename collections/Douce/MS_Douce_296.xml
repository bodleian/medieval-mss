                        <note> Calendar for the use of Crowland Abbey, laid out one month per page,
                           written in black, blue, red and green (ed. by Wormald, 1934). Includes
                           Guthlac (11 April) in blue and his translation (30 August), his sister
                           Pega (8 January), as well as Kyneswida, Kyneburga and Tibba (6 March),
                           Felix of Dunwich (8 March), Alfheah, archbishop of Canterbury (19 April,
                           martyred 1012), Botulph (17 June, in capitals), Athelthryth (23 June, in
                           capitals), Withburga (8 July) and Edmund (20 November, in capitals). Old
                           English names of the months appear to the left of KL monograms. Verses on
                           the ‘Egyptian’ days and on the position of the sun in the Zodiac (Hennig,
                           1955, p. 90) are at the head of each month. Notes on the number of days
                           and nights in each month are at the top of each page and on the number of
                           hours in day and night at the bottom of each page. Added obits of the
                           family of Edmund Ironside (d. 1016) in a contemporary hand in gold:
                           ‘Obiit Eadmundus clitus’ (10 January); ‘Ob(iit) A . . .’ (18 March);
                           ‘Ob(iit) Eaduuardus Clitus anglor(um)’ (19 April, Edward the Exile,
                           1016–1057); ‘Ob(iit) . . . cl . . .’ (24 September). For a discussion of
                           the obits, including the obit on 18 March, partially lost when the leaf
                           was trimmed, see Keynes (1985). Egidius (1 September) in brown, Faith (6
                           October) in green capitals and Catherine (25 November) in red capitals
                           are added in a late 11th- or early 12th-century hand. Further additions
                           in a 12th-century hand include the obit of Lanzo, prior of the Cluniac
                           Priory of St Pancras, Lewes (1 April, d. 1107), Anselm of Canterbury (21
                           April, d. 1109) and Hugh of Cluny (29 April, d. 1109). </note>

                        <note> Calendarial tables. The Easter table (fol. 8r) has a cross above the
                           column for 1060–1087, probably in the original hand (see Rushforth, 2008,
                           ‘Crowland Psalter’, p. 157); fol. 8v is blank. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150 (Gallican version) in the biblical order, written with
                           each verse starting on a new line. Imperfect owing to the loss of three
                           leaves (after fols. 14, 72 and 81). The following text is missing: 9: 16
                           (‘gentes de terra illius . . .’) – 12: 2 (‘. . . Quamdiu ponam
                           consilia’); 101: 1–11 (‘. . . Dies mei sicut umbra’); 108: 19–end (‘sicut
                           uesti . . .’). Between fols. 83 and 84 a contemporary correction slip,
                           with verses 5 and 6 of psalm 113, preceded by ‘h’ (‘hic’ (?)). The
                           omission of verses on fol. 83v is marked with ‘d’ (‘deficit’ (?)).
                           Punctuated throughout with metrum usually marked with a medial point
                           (placed mid-line) or punctus elevatus, and the ends of verses usually
                           marked with a low point (placed on the line of writing) or punctus
                           versus. The psalms are preceded by titles, which do not conform to any of
                           Salmon’s series (1959), and their numbers in Roman numerals. The titles
                           of five psalms are quoted below: 15 Tituli inscriptio ipsi david (fol.
                           15v) 30 Psalmus ipsi david (fol. 25r) 63 Psalmus david (fol. 46r) 115
                           Psalmus david alleluia (fol. 84v) 140 Psalmus david (fol. 100v). There
                           are textual divisions at psalms 1, 51, 101(?), 109, 118 and 119 (see
                           ‘Decoration’). Subdivisions within psalms are marked with larger or gold
                           initials, a line of text in capitals and sometimes ‘Gloria’ in red at 9:
                           20 (fol. 14r), 17: 26 (fol. 18r), 36: 27 (fol. 30r), 67: 20 (fol. 49r),
                           68: 17 (fol. 50r), 77: 36 (fol. 57v), 88: 20 (fol. 65v), 103: 25 (fol.
                           75r), 104: 23 (fol. 76v), 105: 32 (fol. 78v), 106: 25 (fol. 80r), 138: 11
                           (Et dixi . . ., fol. 99v), 144: 10 (fol. 103r). Psalm 118 is subdivided
                           into twenty-two 8-verse units. At the end: ‘Finiunt psalmi dauid numero
                           centum quinquaginta’. </note>

                        <note> Litany (ed. Lapidge, 1991) including Mary, Peter and Guthlac in
                           capitals. Peter and Guthlac are invoked twice. Florentinus (relics at
                           Peterborough from 1015), Alban, Oswald, Edmund, Edward, Kenelm and
                           Alfheah among the martyrs; Benedict (first), Cuthbert, Neot, Erkenwald,
                           Birinus, Swithin, Judoc, Botulph, Athelwold, Dunstan, Aidan and Egwin
                           among the confessors; Athelthryth, Withburga, Sexburga, Ermenilda, Pega,
                           Kyneburga, Kyneswida, Tibba, Tova, Osgitha among the virgins. Egidius,
                           Faith and Catherine added on fols. 117v and 118r in a late 11thor early
                           12th-century hand. The litany is followed by prayers (fols. 119v–127v),
                           including prayers before and after the recitation of the psalms (fol.
                           120v), for various intentions, to the persons of the Trinity (124v), the
                           Virgin Mary (125r), Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, angels, John the Baptist,
                           Peter, Paul, Andrew, twelve apostles, Stephen, Benedict, Gregory and All
                           Saints. On fols. 121v–124v a prayer attributed to St Augustine, entitled
                           ‘Incipit inquisitio sancti augustini episcopi . . .’, beginning ‘Domine
                           ihesu christe qui in hunc mundum propter nos peccatores de sinu patris
                           aduenisti . . .’. Owing to the loss of a leaf after fol. 124 a prayer
                           entitled ‘Oratio ad spiritum sanctum’ ends imperfectly with ‘existens ab
                           eis in enar . . .’. The next prayer begins imperfectly with ‘. . . me ab

                           hand (ed. Raw, 1999). Imperfect after most of Sext; the use is secular,
                           rather than monastic (see Raw, 1999). Written for a woman: prayers at
                           Lauds contain feminine forms (fol. 129v). ‘AMEN’ in capitals is added at
                           the end over the erased gold rubric ‘Coll[ecta]’. Fols. 131–133 are

                        depicting the Triumphant Christ with cruciform halo, wearing a diadem and
                        holding a book and a cross-staff. He treads on a lion and dragon, and
                        pierces the lion’s mouth with the staff. </decoNote>

                        The written space is enclosed in a square frame in gold (flaking) and green.
                        The beginning of psalm 1 is written in gold (flaking).</decoNote>
                     <decoNote type="histInit">Psalm 51 (fol. 40v) starts with a panelled
                        historiated initial Q(uid) topped by an animal mask and containing in the
                        bowl of the initial a figure of a young man in a short tunic and hat
                        (sometimes identified as St Michael, though wingless). He is holding a
                        shield and raising a sword against a winged dragon forming the tail of the
                        Q. The outline of the initial is in gold and the opening lines of text are
                        in gold, green, red and blue capitals.</decoNote>
                     <decoNote type="decInit">Psalms 109 and 118 (fols. 82r and 86r) start with
                        large gold initials, the latter with foliate scrolls, and the opening lines
                        of the text are in gold capitals. Psalm 119 (fol. 92v) and the first
                        canticle (fol. 106r) start with large coloured initials and the opening
                        lines of text are in coloured capitals.</decoNote>
                     <decoNote type="other">Decoration is doubtless lost owing to the loss of a leaf containing
                        the beginning of psalm 101 (after fol. 72). The eleven missing verses would
                        have occupied approximately one page (i.e. the verso of the missing leaf),
                        so the recto probably had a fullpage miniature or initial. Another full-page
                        miniature on a verso probably faced the beginning of psalm 109, as the
                        thirteen missing verses of psalm 108 would have fitted on the recto of the
                        missing leaf.</decoNote>

                     terminus post quem for the manuscript. Rushforth (2008, ‘Crowland Psalter’)
                     argues that obits added in gold in the calendar are contemporary with the
                     production of the psalter and, together with the cross in the Easter table,
                     suggest that the manuscript was written in the 1060s. (Cf. <ref target="http://mlgb3.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/mlgb/book/1848">MLGB3</ref>:
