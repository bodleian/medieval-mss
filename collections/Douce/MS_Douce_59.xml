                        <note> Psalms 1–150, in the biblical order, laid out with each verse
                           starting on a new line. Punctuated throughout, with low point (placed on
                           the line of writing) used to mark metrum and minor pauses, and medial
                           point (placed mid-line) used to mark the ends of verses. Psalm numbers in
                           Roman numerals are written in red ink in the margins in the original
                           hand. The psalms have short titles which do not correspond to any of
                           Salmon’s series (1959). The titles of five psalms are quoted below: <list>

                        <note> A leaf, which probably contained the title of psalm 1 and a
                           miniature, is missing after fol. 3.</note>
                        <note> Subdivisions within psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118,
                           subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse units, headed with the names of the
                           letters of Hebrew alphabet in Latin transliteration (e.g. ‘aleph’,
                           ‘gimel’, etc.). There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 38, 51, 68, 80,
                           97, 101, 109, 114, 121, 126, 131, 137 and 143 (see ‘Decoration’).</note>
                        <note> The larger initials mark the following: <list>
                              <item>– the division into ‘three fifties’ (psalms 1, 51, 101);</item>
                              <item> – psalms appointed to be read first at Matins during the week
                                 in secular use, apart from psalm 52 (1, 26, 38, 68, 80, 97);</item>
                              <item> – psalm 109 appointed to be read first at Sunday Vespers in
                                 both monastic and secular use;</item>

                                 secular use (114, 121, 126, 131, 137 and 143).</item>
                           </list> The division into ‘three fifties’ is particularly prominent.
                           Psalms 51 and 101 start on a new page and are preceded by full-page
                           miniatures. Their titles, in square capitals, are generously spaced out,
                           occupying the whole of the rectos of the leaves containing miniatures.

                        manuscripts made in the area of Reims in the 9th century, particularly the
                        Troyes and Utrecht psalters (see ‘Provenance’). The similarities between the
                        three psalters include the style of decoration and the choice of scenes for
                        the miniatures. Originally psalm 1 was almost certainly preceded by a
                        miniature, now missing.
