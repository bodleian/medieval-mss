                           and black (both red and blue are used for important feasts),
                           approximately one-third full, not graded. Contains Sulpice of Bourges (17
                           January), Peter of Verona (2 June), Gervasius and Prothasius (19 June),

                           December) and his translation (9 May), Stephen (26 December) and the
                           invention of his relics (3 August), all in red. Martin (11 November) is

                           February; relics in Conflans, near the mouth of the Oise, France, after
                           1082), Albinus of Angers (1 March), Beneuree (Felix of Dunwich (?), 7

                           the solar and lunar month (e.g. ‘Januier a .xxxi. Iour. La lune .xxx.’,
                           etc.); the ‘Egyptian’ days are marked with a ‘D’. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, written with each verse starting on a new line, without
                           titles, with numbers added in the margins in Roman and Arabic numerals
                           (see ‘Provenance’). Punctuated throughout, with punctus used to mark the
                           ends of verses and punctus elevatus used to mark metrum and minor pauses.
                           Psalms 37: 20–38: 12 and 51: 8–52: 4 are missing owing to the removal of
                           leaves at liturgical divisions at psalms 38 and 52 after fols. 57 and 75
                           respectively. The psalms are in the biblical order; subdivisions within
                           psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into 8-verse
                           units (verse 137 is not marked, see below). There are textual divisions
                           at psalms 26, 68, 80, 97 and 109. Originally there were also doubtless
                           historiated initials at psalms 38 and 52.</note>
                        <note> There are notes in purplish-red ink in the margins throughout the
                           manuscript, noting errors in the text. Some errors have been corrected,
                           presumably in the original scriptorium, e.g. fols. 188r, 215r, 232r,
                           232v, 233r, etc. Psalm 113 (‘In exitu Israel ...’), fol. 167v, starts
                           with a 1-line initial, even though the second letter is an enlarged
                           capital. Verse 137 (‘Iustus ...’), fol. 182v, in psalm 118 is not marked
                           with a larger initial, even though the psalm is generally subdivided into
                           8-verse units. In both cases the reason is presumably an oversight (‘I’
                           was easy for the illuminator to overlook, because the scribe did not
                           leave a space for it indented into the text area as was his practice with
                           other letters). </note>

                     venerated in France, but is not particularly specific. Morgan (2009) suggests
                     the Oise region as a possible place of origin. Pächt and Alexander (1966–73)
                     point out that the style of illumination is related to Honoré’s atelier, but
                     this is rejected by Morgan (2009). Vitzthum (1907) argues that the illumination
                     is related to a group of manuscripts which he located in Reims. </provenance>

                     penitentiali ...’. The psalter also contains added psalm numbers in Roman
                     numerals, which may be in the same or possibly an earlier hand. </provenance>
