                           characteristic of the Mosan region and Liège (the calendar of the Mosan
                           region and a list of local feasts of the Mosan region and Liège are
                           published by Oliver, 1988, Appendix 1): Servatius, bishop of Tongres (13
                           May) with octave and translation (7 June), and Lambert, bishop of Liège
                           (17 September) with octave and translation (28 April), both in red;
                           Vedast and Amand (6 February), Gertrude of Nivelles (17 March), Ursmar of

                           headed by verses on the ‘Egyptian’ days, which largely correspond to
                           Hennig’s (1955) set I, and notes on the length of the solar and lunar

                        <note> 15th-century additions in an Italian hand comprise Roman saints and
                           feasts, including Valentine (14 February), the dedication of the Lateran
                           Basilica (9 November), the dedication of the Basilica Santa Maria
                           Maggiore (‘Sancte Marie ad Niues’, 5 August), the dedication of the
                           Basilicas of Sts Peter and Paul (November 18) and the feasts of Peter and
                           Paul. Other added feasts are Matthias (February 24), the Visitation (3
                           July), Anne (26 July), Assumption of the Virgin Mary (15 August),
                           Bartholomew (24 August), All Saints and All Souls (1–2 November), Ambrose
                           (7 December) and the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary (8
                           December). The feasts of Agnes (21 January), Mark (25 April), the
                           martyrdom of John the Baptist (29 August) and the Exaltation of the Cross
                           (September 14) are underlined in dark red ink, apparently by the hand
                           which added the Roman feasts. </note>

                        <note> Psalms 1–150, in the biblical order, laid out as prose, without
                           numbers. Psalm 108 is followed by Gloria. Rubric ‘PS’ (‘psalmus’) at the
                           beginning of most psalms. Punctuated throughout with punctus elevatus
                           used to mark metrum and minor pauses, and punctus used to mark the ends
                           of verses. Some psalms are accompanied by cues of antiphons and hymns,
                           without rubrics. The following text is missing: <list>
                              <item>– two bifolia (?) missing after fol. 53 (missing text 32: 16–34:

                              <item>– one bifolium missing after fol. 61 (missing text 37: 12–38: 6) </item>

                           </list> There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 51, 68, 97 and 109 (see
                           ‘Decoration’). Originally there were probably illuminated initials at the
                           beginnings of psalms 38, 52, 80 and 101, now missing. Subdivisions within
                           psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118, subdivided into
                           twenty-two 8-verse units. Psalm 66 is repeated on fol. 90v, after psalm
                           62. Psalms 62 and 66 were appointed to be recited as the third and fourth
                           psalms at all Lauds during the week in the secular use. </note>

                           1) and is accompanied by a petition ‘Ut clerum et plebem sancte marie
                           sanctique lamberti conseruare digneris’ (fol. 232r), followed by two
                           versions of ‘Ut dompnum apostolicum ...’ (fol. 231r), more petitions (Ego

                        <note> Added prayer in a 15th-century Italian hand, imperfect at the end:
                           ‘Benedictus sis tu deus creator omnium qui cum Maria virgine esse sine
                           grauamine voluisti et de ea immaculatam carnem sine peccato assumere
