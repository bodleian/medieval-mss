                        <note>Calendar, written in black and red, laid out one month per page,
                           approximately half full, largely ungraded apart from a few major feasts
                           graded ‘duplex’ or ‘semiduplex’, with 16th- to 18-century additions.
                           Includes Domnio (7 May; alleged first bishop of Salona in Dalmatia),
                           Lawrence (10 August) as duplex, Giovanni Orsini of Trogir and his
                           translation (14 November and 26 June), all in red. Also includes in the
                           original hand Herculanus of Perugia (1 March), Ubaldus of Gubbio (16 May)
                           and the assumption of Elijah (?) (‘Assumpcio Helye prophete’, 20 July).
                           Comemoracio sancti Ioannis Traguriensis ob liberationem Clyssie’ (11
                           April) is added in a 16th-century hand. Other 16th- and 17th-century
                           additions include Longinus as duplex (15 March), Francis of Paola as
                           duplex (2 April), canonized in 1519, Vincent Ferrer as duplex (6 April),
                           Januarius (19 September), Mercurius (21 November) and Maximus (martyr, 29
                           October). 18th-century additions in the hand which supplied an
                           alphabetical table of contents on the lower pastedown (see below) include
                           the dedication of the Cathedral of St Lawrence in Trau (Trogir),
                           Dalmatia, on 12 August (‘dedicatio sancti Laurentij Trã . Ecclesie’),
                           Clare of Assisi (12 August), Sancti Angeli Custodis (10 October) and an
                           expanded record for the feast of Giovanni Orsini (‘Festum ... Tragum
                           Prot. cum Octaua’). Months are headed by notes on the length of the solar
                           and lunar month and on the number of hours in day and night. </note>

                           12035). The hymns are preceded by a rubric: ‘Incipit psalterium secundum
                           vsum curie Romane’ and followed by antiphons with music. </note>

                        <note> Psalms, appointed for reading at Matins and Lauds on Sundays, Prime,
                           Terce, Sext and None, and Matins and Lauds during the week according to
                           secular use. Originally there may have been another volume containing
                           psalms for Vespers and Compline (similarly to MSS. Lat. liturg. a. 1 and
                           Lat. liturg. a. 2, two parts of a complete ferial psalter with a somewhat
                           different order of psalms). The psalms are laid out as prose, without
                           numbers, most preceded by rubrics ‘psalmus dauid’ or ‘psalmus’.
                           Punctuated throughout with punctus flexus used to mark minor pauses,
                           punctus elevatus used to mark metrum, and punctus used to mark the ends
                           of verses. There are textual divisions at psalms 26, 52, 68, 80 and 97
                           (see ‘Decoration’). The beginning of psalm 38 is missing (see below). The
                           divisions within psalms are not indicated, apart from psalm 118,
                           subdivided into twenty-two 8-verse sections. Psalms are accompanied by
                           antiphons, versicles, responses, chapters, prayers and hymns with rubrics
                           and music (square notation on staves of four red lines). The margins
                           contain liturgical notes in early modern (up to the 18th century) hands.
                           Added running titles in the upper margin mark the sections of psalter
                           appointed for recitation on different days of the week (‘feria secunda’,
                           fols. 75v–76r, ‘feria tertia’, fols. 102v–103r, etc.). They are in an
                           18th-century hand which made additions to the calendar and added a table
                           of contents on the lower pastedown. Psalms, canticles, hymns, chapters
                           and creeds are in the following order: <list>

                        <condition> Extensive heat (?) damage on some leaves, causing severe
                           pleating at intervals throughout the book (damage from a nearby light
                           fitting (?)). Many leaves are mutilated and repaired with white
                           18th-century laid paper, possibly when the table of contents was added to
                           the lower pastedown and other alterations were made in the 18th century.
                           Some leaves are repaired with brown 19th-century paper, similar to that
                           used for the fly-leaves, probably in the Bodleian. Fragments of the
                           18th-century paper (used as bookmarks attached to leaves (?)) also
                           occasionally appear in the outer margins, often on leaves badly damaged
                           by heat. Such fragments occur, for example, at the beginnings of the
                           Penitential Psalms: 6 (fol. 4v), 31 (fol. 83r), 37 (fol. 93v), 50 (fol.
                           90r), 101 (fol. 193v) and 142 (fol. 185v). Some such fragments contain
                           printed or handwritten text, e.g. fols. 32v, 48v, 80v, 83r, 183v, 193v,
                           etc. Strips of parchment cut from a medieval manuscript with fragments of
                           text were used to repair and reattach several leaves (e.g. fols. 103, 118
                           and 127)</condition>

                     includes an invocation of St Lawrence. </provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was still in use in Trau in the 16th to 18th centuries
                     when various additions were made (see the description of the calendar).
                     Additions in an 18th-century hand include foliation, the table of contents on
                     the lower pastedown, the opening lines of psalm 38 on fol. 102v, running titles
                     and several feasts to do with Trau in the calendar. In the 18th century the
                     manuscript was probably repaired and bookmarks were added. </provenance>
