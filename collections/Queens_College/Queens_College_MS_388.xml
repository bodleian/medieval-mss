                     <note>The entries consist of the name of a liturgical occasion in red, abbreviated reference to a book and chapter of the Bible, an indexing letter in red, the opening words of a reading, <q>ende</q> in red, and the closing words of a reading. Includes the temporal, commemorations and the sanctoral. Commemorations are in the following order: Our Lady, Trinity, Holy Ghost, cross, angels, brothers and sisters and <q>salus populi</q>, peace, clear weather, rain, <q>In tyme of batels</q>, <q>A man for him self</q>, <q>pestilence of beestes</q>, pilgrims, weddings, sinners, sick and dead. Includes all feasts characteristic of the Later Version of the Wycliffite Bible, apart from Giles (1 September) (Forshall, J. and Madden, F. (eds), <title>The Holy Bible … in the earliest English versions made from the Latin Vulgate by John Wycliffe and his followers</title>, 4 vols (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1850), vol. 4, pp. 683, 690–6). Conception of our Lady, Candlemas, Annunciation, Nativity of John the Baptist, Peter and Paul, Assumption, Nativity of our Lady, Exaltation of the Cross (September) and Halloween start with blue initials. About two-thirds of fol. 7v are ruled for the table of lections but blank; fol. 8r–v is originally blank (see Provenance).</note>

                     <note>Imperfect at the beginning, starting at Genesis 1:20 (<q>…þe erþe vndur þe firmament</q>). Unique prologues to all books from Exodus to Proverbs (except 2 Chronicles which originally must have had a prologue but lacks the beginning because of the loss of a leaf after fol. 152; missing 1 Chronicles, 29:7–2 Chronicles, 3:1) and to Jeremiah and 1 Maccabees. The prologues to Ezekiel and Daniel are shared with Cambridge, University Library, MS. Dd. I. 27. The unique prologues are listed in Dove, M., <title>The first English Bible: the text and context of the Wycliffite versions</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 200–4 (siglum M), apart from the prologue to Joshua <q>This book of iosue makiþ mynde how þe lord…</q>
                        <locus>(fol. 77v)</locus>, and printed in Forshall, J. and Madden, F. (eds), <title>The Holy Bible … in the earliest English versions made from the Latin Vulgate by John Wycliffe and his followers</title>, 4 vols (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1850). The books from Ecclesiastes to Ecclesiasticus have longer than usual rubrics, some explaining that they do not need prologues: <q>Here endiþ þe book of prouerbis &amp; here bigynneþ þe book of ecclesiastes þat tretiþ also of wisdom &amp; prudence &amp; nediþ noon oþer prologe</q> (Ecclesiastes, fol. 228v); <q>Here endiþ þe book of ecclesiastes &amp; here bigynneþ þe book of song of songis þat weren maad of salomon to be sungen in þe temple of þe lord in to euerelastinge wurschiping &amp; nediþ noon þe prologe</q> (Song of Songs, fol. 231v); <q>Here endiþ þe book of songis &amp; here bigynneþ þe book of wisdom which is red in holi cherche in lessouns of þe masse for þe mater þerof is goostli &amp; profecie of þingis to comynge</q> (Wisdom, fol. 233r); <q>Here endiþ þe book of wisdom and here bigynneþ þe book of ecclesiasticus þat tretiþ also of wisdom and prudence in many degrees of þe world</q> (Ecclesiasticus, fol. 238v). Usual the Later Version of the Wycliffite Bible prologues to Isaiah and Baruch; no prologues to Hosea-Malachi and 2 Maccabees.</note>
                     <note>Rubrics in red, e.g., <q>Here endiþ þe book of genesis &amp; here bigynneþ a prologe on þe book of exodi</q>, <q>Here endiþ þe prologe &amp; here biginneþ þe book of Exodi</q>. Running titles above each column in red preceded by blue paraphs, consisting of book titles only. Chapter numbers in red Roman numerals. Added material within the text is underlined in black. No marginal glosses; includes a few of a series of glosses in Pentateuch written within the text (see Dove, M., <title>The first English Bible: the text and context of the Wycliffite versions</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 264). Indexing letters occasionally appear in the margins placed at the beginnings of lections rather than consistently; double strokes in the margins at the ends of lections. Corrections in the original or contemporary hands, those in the margins are sometimes in red boxes. Red and blue paraphs within the text. Rubrics in Esther and Daniel pointing out the differences between the Latin and Hebrew texts.</note>
                     <note>Psalms written as prose with verses starting with alternating 1-line red or blue initials. Each psalm is preceded by a title in red ink. Latin incipits are added in a later cursive hand in the margins. Larger initials at the beginnings of psalms 26, 38, 52, 68, 80, 97 and 109. Psalm 118 has 3-line initials at the beginning of 11-verse units. At the end of psalms: <q>Here endiþ þe sauter but more salmes suwen þat ben writen in þe sauter whiche ben writen in diuerse <sic>chapitles</sic> of þe bible <sic>bible</sic> bifore &amp; after whiche it is no nede to writen hem twies þer for we enden here &amp; here bigynneþ a prologe vpon prouerbis of salomon</q>.</note>
                     <note>New Testament starts on a new quire <locus>(fol. 361r)</locus> following a larger than usual 10-leaf quire at the end of Old Testament and ends with a 10-leaf quire; books have usual the Later Version of the Wycliffite Bible prologues. The Apocalypse ends in the first column on fol. 449v; the second column and fol. 250 are blank.</note>
