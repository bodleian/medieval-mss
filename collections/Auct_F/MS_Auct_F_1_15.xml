                        <p>The two parts were bound together, most probably in 1411-1412 in Exeter
                           (Clarkson 1996: 164). A parchment fly at the back of the book was a
                           former pastedown. The original oak boards were reversed when the book was
                           rebound and covered, in Oxford, in around 1600. The whittawed sheepskin
                           covers are very worn. The inner boards are now bare wood with traces of
                           paste and on the inner front board there are offsets of a text in
                           carolingian minuscule.</p>
                        <p> [Note: A paper card has been pasted on the inside back board on the
                           exposed wood with a note in pencil: 'from inside at end 22.1.1904
                           E.W.B.N: The card has a small window for a parchment fragment which looks
                           to be in a late 10c anglo-caroline hand, and reads 'uin' on the recto and
                           'acd' on the verso. The offsets on the inside front board match in minim
                           height the script on the tiny fragment.] </p>
                        <p>Flyleaves at front and back were originally pastedowns, as paste remains
                           on f. i recto and f. 93 verso. The front flyleaf (f. i) and the back
                           fly (f. 93) were not original to the A-S book, as the wormholes in the
                           textblocks, leaves, and covers do not match and the parchment is a
                           thicker type and undamaged by mold as are the first several leaves of
                           Part 1 and last several leaves of Part 2. Furthermore, the rust stains on
                           the covers and ff. 1-2 that postdate the 1411-12 refurbishment and
                           chaining in the Exeter library are absent on the fly, suggesting that
                           these leaves were bound into the book in c. 1600. Clarkson suggests that
                           the upper board is original from the Boethius and the lower board
                           originally from the Persius (1996: 167). The book originally was sewn in
                           three stations not counting the endbands, but was resewn onto four
                           stations in the early 15c refurbishment. The spine is very worn with
                           labels at the lower two gaps between stations; the top one has the
                           shelfmark 'F. 1. 15' and the lower one bears an old shelfmark, 'Arch. F.
                           c. 16'. The inner front board has a small label in the top left 'S.C.
                           2455' and offset carolingian minuscule text.</p>
                        <p>New covers were put over the original (but reversed) boards, ca. 1602
                           (Clarkson 1996: passim and Watson 1987: 270), when it was gifted to the
                           Bodleian, and the book was clipped and chained in the Bodleian in the 17c. The turn-in of the covers was partly lifted in 1973-74 at the
                           Bodleian as part of a dendrochronological study (as reported by Clarkson
                           1996: 165). According to notes and photographs kept in its storage box,
                           the manuscript was refurbished in February of 1977.</p>

               <history>

                  <provenance>A composite volume consisting of two manuscripts from St. Augustine's,
                     Canterbury, written in anglo-caroline minuscule of the later 10c: Boethius' "De
                     Consolatione Philosophiae" and Persius' "Satirae''. The Boethius is glossed
                     with an insular (and incomplete) version of the Remigian commentary, scholia,
                     and glosses (Wittig 2006: 179 and 191) as well as the third "Vita" and Lupus of
                     Ferrieres' "De metris" (Gibson and Smith 1995: no. 163). The copy is textually
                     related to Cambridge, Trinity College O.3.7 (90), which represents a fairly
                     full text of the Remigian gloss (Courcelle 1939: 121-22, Bolton 1977a: 381-82,
                     Bolton 19776: 52-53). The copy of Persius' "Satirae" has a version of the
                     "Commentum Cornuti" glosses and scholia, borrowing from the "Tradition B" for
                     the preface and prologue, and reverting to the "Tradition A" family of glosses
                     for the satires proper (Pulsiano 2001: 146-49; for the traditions see Robathan
                     and Cranz 1976: 3.215-24). The Persius is closely related to, and may have
                     ultimately shared an exemplar with, Cambridge, Trinity College O.4.10, and M.R.
                     James suggests this exemplar may derive from a copy found at Theodore and
                     Hadrian's Canterbury school (James 1902: 3.258). T.A.M. Bishop placed the
                     origin of both parts of the manuscript at St. Augustine's based on scribal
                     interrelations with other manuscripts (Bishop 1971: no. 9; 1959-63: 415, also
                     Barker-Benfield 2008: 3.1815-16). The Boethius was subsequently but nearly
                     contemporaneously glossed at <orgName key="org_158353196">Christ Church,
                        Canterbury</orgName>, attesting to close relations between the foundations
                     in the late 10c (Bishop 1971: 7).</provenance>
                  <provenance> Leofric probably acquired the manuscripts from Canterbury (Bishop
                     1959-63: 415; Drage 1978: 271 and 406; Treharne 2009: 524) and certainly
                     donated the two manuscripts to <orgName role="fmo" key="org_127815410"
                        >Exeter</orgName> as separate items in the third quarter of the 11c; both
                     parts are identifiable with entries in Leofric's donation inventory (Lapidge
                     1994: 134-35; Conner 1993: 232-34), and both have donation inscriptions. The
                     two manuscripts remained as two separate items in the 1327 inventory of
                     Exeter's holdings (Oliver 1861: 329; though cf. Drage 1978: 387). They were
                     perhaps bound together in the 14c or, more likely, in the Exeter refurbishment
                     campaign of 1411-1412 (Clarkson 1996: 164-69; Pollard 1975: 144). The compiled
                     book was probably chained in the Exeter library in the late Middle Ages. </provenance>

                           the incipit in five lines of two-line square capitals in various colors,
                           beginning with a blue 'A', and lines in red (now oxidized), green,
                           purple, red and then green again, followed by a very large interlace
                           capital, a line of square capitals five lines high in purple, three-line
                           square capitals in orange, and square capitals two lines high in green,
                           and square capitals one line high in purple. The first letter for each
                           poem is usually a green capital three lines high, with subsequent
                           initials for each line of poetry in red; in prose sections, the initial
                           of each section is usually purple with a line of black rustic capitals.
                           The explicit to book one and incipit to book two are in rustic capitals
                           alternating in red and green. The beginnings of other books are nearly as
                           elaborate, with large interlace initials, very large square capitals in
                           various colors and decreasing size. Book two begins in purple and red;
                           book three and four have red rubrics and initial lines of large square
                           capitals in purple and green; book five has red rubrics and one line of
                           square capitals five lines high.</decoNote>

               343. Oxford, Bodleian Library, Auct. F. 1. 15 (2455)
Boethius, "De Consolatione Philosophiae"; Persius, "Satirae"
[Ker 294; Gneuss 533/534]
HISTORY: 
CODICOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:  The two manuscripts
are different in make-up and layout, and will be described separately.

Part 2, Persius (ff. 78-93): 
The two parts were bound together, most probably in 1411-1412
in Exeter (Clarkson 1996: 164). A parchment fly at the back of the book
was a former pastedown. The original oak boards were reversed when the
book was rebound and covered, in Oxford, in around 1600. The whittawed
sheepskin covers are very worn. The inner boards are now bare wood with
traces of paste and on the inner front board there are offsets of a text in
carolingian minuscule.
[Note: A paper card has been pasted on the inside back board on the exposed wood
with a note in pencil: 'from inside at end 22.1.1904 E.W.B.N: The card has a small
window for a parchment fragment which looks to be in a late 10c anglo-caroline
hand, and reads 'uin' on the recto and 'acd' on the verso. The offsets on the inside
front board match in minim height the script on the tiny fragment.]
Flyleaves at front and back were originally pastedowns, as paste remains on f. <lb/> recto and f. 93 verso. The front flyleaf (f. i) and the back fly (f.
93) were not original to the A-S book, as the wormholes in the textblocks,
leaves, and covers do not match and the parchment is a thicker type and
undamaged by mold as are the first several leaves of Part 1 and last several
leaves of Part 2. Furthermore, the rust stains on the covers and ff. 1-2 that
postdate the 1411-12 refurbishment and chaining in the Exeter library are
absent on the fly, suggesting that these leaves were bound into the book in c.
1600. Clarkson suggests that the upper board is original from the Boethius
and the lower board originally from the Persius (1996: 167). The book originally was sewn in three stations not counting the endbands, but was resewn onto four stations in the early 15c refurbishment. The spine is very
worn with labels at the lower two gaps between stations; the top one has the
shelfmark 'F. J 1. 15' and the lower one bears an old shelfmark, 'Arch. F. I
c. 16'. The inner front board has a small label in the top left 'S.C. 2455' and
offset carolingian minuscule text.
