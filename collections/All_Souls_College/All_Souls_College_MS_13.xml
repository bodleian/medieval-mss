                        Thereafter C and B continue, merging indistinguishably. C is the most <term type="script">gothic</term> and the least accomplished in that he tends to be untidy but the difference is more one of neatness and compactness than of letter-forms. 
                        <persName key="person_4523">Scribe A</persName> wrote mostly but not always above the top line, scribe B had no choice but to do the same on the one page he began, and scribe C wrote consistently below the top line. 
                        Corrections are marked in the margin and parts of the text are rewritten. Omissions are written out in the margin with a <hi rend="italic">signe de renvoi</hi> to and in the text. 
                        Punctuation is by low point and punctus elevatus. Hyphens, original, are in the form of small oblique strokes low on the line.

                        Smaller initials are red, blue, or green. The initials are partly if not wholly in the hand of the artist of <idno type="shelfmark">MS 30</idno>, q.v. for comparisons.</decoNote>

                        <p>Resewn on six bands between projecting bevelled oak boards covered with white alum-tawed skin. 
                           On the spine is a black leather lozenge-shaped label with <q>8</q> on it. 
                           Some bands are exposed on both covers and can be seen to have been brought over the outer surface of the back edge of the boards, not through a tunnel in them. On each cover are holes for five bosses as in <idno type="shelfmark">MS 30</idno>, which came from the same source. 
                           On the front cover are the remains of two straps, the upper now held by three out of five nails, the lower by five nails, all of the usual type. At the top of the front cover, inside and outside, are signs of a chain-staple (position 6). 
                           On the back cover are two metal catches for straps and at the bottom are eight holes for a chain-staple or perhaps staples (six holes, position I, and two holes, slightly higher up). 
                           Two leaves at the back of the book, fol. 199 and the pastedown, are fols. 9-11 from a copy of the <bibl><title rend="italic" key="work_186102457">Margarita poetica</title> of <persName key="person_22136923" role="aut">Albrecht von Eyb</persName></bibl>, of which other leaves are in <idno type="shelfmark">MSS 2, 12, 14, 30, 79, and dd.2.9</idno>: see <idno type="shelfmark">MS 12</idno> for details. 
                           In the present volume the folds have sewing holes, showing that they came from a bound copy. Edges are yellowed and there is a fore-edge title. There appears to be a residue of staining on the front cover.</p>

                  <provenance>The pre-All Souls history of this handsome book is not known but is clearly identical with that of <idno type="shelfmark">MS 30</idno>, which shares with it script, style of decoration, type of catchwords, the unusual way of numbering leaves (in the same hand), and the same frequent use of wavy note marks in the margin. 
                     The covers of both have had bosses, suggestive of northern rather than southern England and of ownership by a Cistercian house (<hi rend="italic">ex info</hi> Michael Gullick). 
                     Both came to the College by gift of <persName key="person_3315">Richard Andrew</persName>, the first Warden (on whom see <hi rend="italic">BRUO</hi> and Walker, 'Andrew'), in the time of the Founder (<bibl>Ker, <title rend="italic">All Souls</title>, List II, no. 43, with <q>Libri theologie cathenati</q></bibl>). 
                     <bibl>No. 26 in James, <title rend="italic">Ecloga</title></bibl>, and <bibl>no. 1413 (12) in <title rend="italic">CMA</title></bibl>. 
                     On fol. i<hi rend="superscript">v</hi>, in a large <term type="script">hybrida formata</term> script, is <q>Exposicio Radulfi flaiacensis Monachi super leuiticum ex donacione Magistri Ricardi Andrew</q> and, below, the 2<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>  folio in the hand that wrote the 2<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> folio in <idno type="shelfmark">MS 12</idno>. 
                     On fol. 2<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> is <hi rend="italic">ex libris</hi> style 1, <q>Liber Collegij animarum omnium fidelium defunctorum de Oxon' ex dono Magistri Ricardi Andrew j<hi rend="superscript">i</hi> custodis</q>. 
                     The book was harshly treated in the <date>1580s</date> when about 36-40 of the final leaves were removed. Sixteen of them, identifiable as coming from quires 27-30, were used as pastedowns in the eight-volume Antwerp edition of the Bible which <persName key="person_4535" role="dnr">Francis Milles</persName> gave to the College in <date>1584</date>, payment for binding of which, recorded in the College accounts, was made to the Oxford binder <persName key="person_4536">Dominic Pinart</persName>. 
                     Two other leaves from quire 30 were used by <persName key="person_4536">Pinart</persName> in the binding of a book now in <orgName key="org_150825867">Winchester College</orgName> Library, Moberly Library, 60A. 
                     <bibl>For this see Ker, <title rend="italic">Pastedowns</title>, p. xi and no. 1168</bibl>, who suggests that <persName key="person_4536">Pinart</persName> may have complained that he had no manuscript leaves suitable for use as pastedowns in a book of this size. 
                     <p>In the present volume All Souls library identifications, on which see Introduction, are, on the front pastedown, <q type="pressmark">vv.Infra.6</q> and <q type="pressmark">ww.r.8</q> (both deleted), <q type="pressmark">MS. i3</q>, <q type="pressmark">L.R. 6.a.6</q> (pencil), and bookplate no. 8, on which is <q>163</q> (pencil).</p>
