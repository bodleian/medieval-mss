Ashmole 45,MS_Ashmole_45,"Late seventeenth-century calf binding over pasteboards typical of Elias Ashmole's style, with ASH. 45 embossed on the central spine panel. The spine is covered in a separate piece of leather from the boards, of the same colour, that extends under the board-covers. The head, tail, and panels of the spine display horizontal concentric tool framing. The spine shows four raised sewing supports covering thick cords which support all four composite parts - three of these cords are intact. The sewing stations do not follow any of the original sewing stations in the composite parts, which show evidence of between five and six stations from previous bindings. This is typical of Ashmole's binding style. However, the spine-cover has likely been replaced since the manuscript left Ashmole's collection. The typeset of the shelf mark is similar, but not identical, to Ashmole's typeset (varying in the height of letters and thickness of vertical strokes in characters A and 4), and Ashmole's embossed crest is missing from the second panel (see e.g. MS Ashmole 44). The board-covers also show evidence of having been lifted up at the spine-edge to allow for the spine-cover to be adhered beneath them.; Due to the varying heights of the composite units, there are no endbands. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels. The boards are cut according to the largest codicological unit, with wide squares. Both boards display concentric frame tooling which is flush with the border on three sides and inset from the spine-border by several centimeters, as is typical of Ashmole's bindings. The absence of the usual concentric frame tooling on the spine side is likely due to cropping of the leather when the new spine-cover was added. The board edges are tooled with a repeating zig-zag pattern typical of Ashmole's bindings. The inner rear board bears an inscription typical of the Bodleian's in-house bindery, with the initial W and the date, partially obscured, 24 - 1 - 51/7. This is likely the work of A. G. Wintersgill, who was employed at the Bodleian for the finishing, furbishing, and repair of bindings from 1949, and whose initials can be seen on other Ashmole bindings (e.g. MS Ashmole 1431).",,,,,1617,1692,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MS_Ashmole_46_binding_1,manuscript_351,Ashmole,MS_Ashmole_46,MS. Ashmole 46,MS_Ashmole_46,"The binding is made of gilt punched leather, using the technique whereby repetitive patterns of geometrical shapes were punched onto the parts of the design that would be left unpainted. It has been coloured with a yellow-gold glaze or tinted varnish, and is decorated with abstract floral designs and a mixture of overlapping punch patterns. On this technique, see Posthuma De Boer, Martine, E. F. Koldeweij, and Roger M. Groves, Gilt Leather Artefacts (2016).; The leather covers paste boards typical of the sixteenth century, and shows remnants of two metal clasps with flower motif pins, which were once attached to leather straps. Comparable hardware can be seen in the bindings of Matthew Parker from the second half of the sixteenth century, now Corpus Christi College Cambridge SP.66, SP.57, and SP.244.; The binding is recycled from a larger piece of punched leather, likely a sixteenth century panelled wall hanging or screen - although the dating of the punched pattern is much harder to determine. Similar designs are found on sixteenth century Italian wall hangings in the V&A Collection (items O304822, O304824, and O369581) which suggest a plausible place and date of origin.; Although this leather was prevalent in luxury homes and churches from the sixteenth century, the practice of recycling leather wall hangings into book bindings is a rare phenomenon. A few examples can be found on printed books which were bound in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Italy and Spain. The binding of MS Ashmole 46 represents one of the earliest known examples of this practice, and to date is the only known manuscript with this style of binding. It is also the only example identified thus far in England.; The current binding is not the manuscript's original binding, as the text block has been trimmed and the page edges gilded at a later date after its production. This binding was likely made before 1588, as it does not match the style in which Sir Thomas Tresham, who owned the manuscript in 1588, bound his manuscripts with his family crest embossed in the centre of the front cover (see British Armorial Bindings, Tresham, Thomas (1543-1605), stamps 1, 2, 3).

Fol. 377 was a pastedown of an earlier binding and contains on the verso staining from a red (leather?) binding. The red is similar to that of parchment tabs which mark the beginning of most books (see Hudson, A., ‘The Carthusians and a Wycliffite Bible’, in Kras, P. et al.

The upper pastedown has a stub before fol. i, in the gutter fold of which one can see the original sewing-stations, which correspond approximately to the present sewing; that the book has been re-sewn, however, is shown by the fact that this stub, in its present position, would have prevented the offset of the 'KL' monogram on fol. 1r onto the upper right corner of the pastedown, so the stub must originally have been hooked around the first quire; in addition the singletons appear to be sewn on modern laid paper guards.; The binding has been noticed by Duff and Prideaux, and mentioned by Gibson; the binding panel is apparently identical with one represented by a rubbing in the Victoria and Albert Museum, described in Weale, Bookbindings in the National Art Library, II, 181 no. 370 ('Flanders.

Talbot states that Pontigny books were usually bound in thick wooden boards, which often split due to the manner of nailing studs into each cover (Talbot (see provenance), 110–11). During the 1820s there was a duty to be paid, by weight, on the import of all manuscripts written before 1801; the duty for bound books being higher than for unbound ones (see A. N. L. Munby, Phillipps Studies, III (Cambridge, 1954), 33), and it is therefore quite possible that Allard (see under Provenance) might have removed any heavy binding of no apparent interest, and then had the volume rebound inexpensively once in England.",,,,,1800,1900,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemise is lined with tawed skin, to which are sewn pink leather pouches to take the boards of the binding, which are white leather over wood. The boards sewn on seven thongs, as in Pollard’s Figures 4 and 5, s. xiv. Although the embroidered covering may be of Italian manufacture, the binding as a whole does not appear to have originated in Italy. Indeed, Frederick Bearman, ‘The Origins and Significance of Two Late Medieval Textile Chemise Bookbindings in the Walters Art Gallery’, The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 54 (1996), 163–87 (166) proposes that it is ‘more appropriately understood as an English fifteenth-century(?) textile chemise binding, made of contemporary red velvet with embroidered decoration, possibly of Italian manufacture’. For a discussion of the binding in a wider context, see Jan Storm van Leeuwen, ‘The Well-Shirted Bookbinding. On chemise bindings and Hülleneinbände’ in T. Croiset van Uchelen et al., Theatrum Orbis Librorum: Liber Amicorum Presented to Nico Israel on the Occasion of his Seventieth Birthday (Utrecht, 1989), 277–305 at 294 (no. 6).We have a vague terminus post quem non for the binding, in as much as a note has been added at the top of the final flyleaf (‘nisi domine / illust[rissime] Reverendissime’; fol. 81) in a secretary script of the mid-fifteenth century. A further suggestion may be added: it may perhaps have been at the point of providing the chemise that pieces of thin material were stitched to the top of several folios, in order to protect the illumination; James records (xxxvii) six locations where these ‘(blue) silk guards’ remain (fol. 14v, 27, 43, 46v, 50, 59v); on one other occasion, some of the thread remains (fol. 24), while in nine instances, the holes for the thread alone survive (fol. 1, 3, 4, 8, 18, 21, 37, 44, 51). On the practice of silk guards generally, see Christine Sciacca, ‘Raising the Curtain on the Use of Textiles in Manuscripts’ in Kathryn M.

Bound on three threads in brown calf leather; boards made from leather-covered wood and heavily decorated: plate stamp (negative plate) on the front board showing the crucifixion with inscription ‘PROPTER SCELVS POPVLI MEI’ [percussi eum, Jes. 53:8]; plate stamp (negative plate) on the lower board showing the resurrection with inscription ‘MORS ERO MORS TVA MORS’ [-us tuus ero, inferne, Hos. 13:14]. These stamps are identical with those found on the bindings of Munich, Bayrische Staatsbibliothek Inc.c.a. 77 a, an incunabulum which was rebound in 1586, and Vienna, Museum für angewandte Kunst–Barockbibliothek, S 25, which apparently was also written at St. Nikolaus in undis in the late 16th century and has a very similarly designed binding. Identification numbers of the plate stamps: EBDB p002705 and EBDB p002704; the connection of them to Konrad Haebler, Rollen- und Plattenstempel des XVI. Jahrhunderts (Leipzig, 1928–1929), I 378, X and the concluding ascription to a Nuremberg binder given in the EBDB prove to be false. Roll stamps around the centers of both front and back cover showing (1) symbols of the four evangelists, each of them with a book and surrounded by floral elements, (2) biblical quotes: ‘DATA EST MIHI OM’ [-nis potestas, Mt. 28:18], ‘TV ES PETRVS ET’ [super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam, Mt. 16:18], ‘ECCE AGNVS DEI’ [qui tollit peccatum, Joh. 1:29], ‘APPARVIT BENI’ [-gnitas et humanitas, Tit. 3:4], (3) apostles with their symbols: old man with two keys and a book, identifiable as Peter; man with sword and closed book, identifiable as Paul; man with a Cross, probably James; man with a book. Identical with a roll stamp found on the binding of Munich, Bayrische Staatsbibliothek, ESlg/J.can.p. 343, bearing the identification number EBDB r002888 and described in Konrad Haebler, Rollen- und Plattenstempel des XVI. Jahrhunderts (Leipzig, 1928–1929), II 229, 55. Ruling on both boards as well as on the spine. Remains of two small brass clasps; strips missing, catchplates on the front board. Edges of the boards slanted. Headband braided from beige and brown hemp threads. Front joint damaged. No binding fragments visible.

Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_27_binding_1,manuscript_16050,Lincoln_College,Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_27,Lincoln College MS. Lat. 27,Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_27,"A mid-fifteenth-century binding—after 1462, the date on an endleaf—of quarter-sawn oak boards, cushion-bevelled, overhanging the text-block on all sides, and covered with whittawed skin. This cover has been patched with reverse skin where it has worn away or been torn, including on the spine; but it has not been rebacked. Sewn on five double whittawed thongs, raised at the spine. Both pastedowns are lifted, revealing the V-lacing arrangement of the top and bottom braces with the centre thong taken straight, all pegged. The supports are breaking where the quires were removed towards the centre of the volume; the fact of the gap here rather suggests that this is the original sewing. Endbands are structural and of blue and undyed thread, around an alum-tawed leather core, woven with three beads and worked through the covering of both head- and tailcaps. There is no use of red stain. Striations at the middle of the fore-edge of both boards are tying-up marks. There are in addition the grooves left in the upper board by paired fore-edge clasps. Their material is unknown, but they were each secured by two nails and fastened not to catch-plates, for which there is no evidence, but apparently to pins on the centre line of the lower board; these are sawn off but the metal remains visible. There are the marks of two chaining stations: it is probably the medieval staple which was attached at the foot of the fore-edge on the upper board; this staple was rectangular with two nail holes. The impress and nail holes of the usual early-modern College clip are at the fore-edge of the lower board towards the head. On the back cover north of centre is an oblong arrangement of eight nail-holes revealing the former position of the title-piece, which would have been fixed beneath a sheet of horn by a latten frame. The space bounded by the nail holes is 30 × 105 mm. The parchment title-piece is now pasted to fol. 7r (see Labels and marks); it is cut down, measuring 17 × 90 mm. Pastedowns and rear flyleaf are cut-down documents of the fifteenth century (two dated 1461 and 1462) from the diocese of Lincoln (see above), raising the likelihood that the binding was done for Robert Flemming, dean of Lincoln from 1452 until his death in 1483. ; Labels and marks: The medieval title-piece from the back board is now pasted at the foot of fol. 7r. In the secondary Textura hand it reads, ‘Expositio Bernardi super Missus est gabriel cum aliis contentis ex dono Magistri Roberti Flemmyng’ Decani lincoln’’. Centred at the top of the same page is the James number ‘27’ written in Gerard Langbaine’s brown ink. The early-modern shelf-mark, ‘E. 47. 1’ is on fol. [ii]r, with the unidentified mark above it, ‘N.59.’ The College bookplate of 1703 is affixed at the centre of what was the front pastedown, now lifted. Beneath it is pencilled the Bodleian shelf-mark: ‘MS. Linc. Coll. (e) Lat. 27’. On the spine, vestiges of two square paper labels: at the head, a printed arabic numeral 2[[7]]; at the tail, the pale blue Bodleian label with printed modern shelf-mark.",,,,,1462,1480,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fore-edges are sprinkled red. Marks of the usual college chain clip are at the fore-edge of the back board towards the foot, with verdigris inside. The joint has split entirely on the top board and is half split on the lower; but the condition otherwise is very good. Flyleaves of tough medieval parchment, contemporary with the text-block: the front pastedown is lifted; the rear pastedown is partly loose at the top corner and has been cut away at the bottom corner where the brass chain-clip was.

The boards from the former binding are housed with the volume in a separate folder. These boards are the typical 18th century Rawlinson binding of marbled paper boards with parchment spine lining and paper pastedown. The spine lining shows evidence of six raised sewing supports in the former binding. Six paper end leaves from this binding are still present in the manuscript. A note from Bruce Barker-Benfield on the final of these end leaves (foliated 119) records that One further flyleaf of this late 19th cent. paper after 119 was removed and destroyed in the rebinding of 1985. Barker-Benfield also conducted a collation survey of the manuscript after rebinding, now housed in the Bodley Refs, LVI.16. No other conservation records are preserved.; The current binding (1985) comprises paper boards with external bevels covered in grey paper, with white leather spine lining. The spine shows four single raised sewing supports with projected spine tabs and sewn endbands in white thread. During the 1985 rebinding, paper sewing guards were added to the gutters of folios 9-10 and 21-22, and the gutters of folios 1-2, 5, were reinforced.; Parchment sewing supports are preserved on folios 14-15, 25-26, 37-38, 56-57, 64-65, 72-73, 80-81, 88-89, 101-102, and 109-110.

Selden Supra 56,MS_Selden_Supra_56,"Plain white sheepskin parchment on boards, clasp lost, contemporary English work (fifteenth century); Alexandra Gillespie observes that very few well-known vernacular manuscripts have survived in their medieval bindings and that MS. Selden Supra 56 is one of only four of Chaucer’s works that has a pre-1500 cover. Gillespie names the other three Chaucer manuscripts as MS. Rawl. D. 3, Cambridge, St John’s, MS E. 2 and London, Institution of Engineering and Technology Library, MS Thompson 1 ('Bookbinding' in The Production of Books in England 1350–1500 ed. by Wakelin and Gillespie [Cambridge University Press, 2011], p. 158 and p. 165) ; Hannah Ryley notes that reinforcing strips were used in this manuscript to strengthen the binding by offering support to the sewing of the quires. Ryley comments that from the reader’s point of view, these reinforcing strips are 'narrow stubs poking out from between regular leaves' and that the 'stubby strips either lie flat, because they have been pasted on to adjacent leaves, or they stand up separately'. Ryley records strips at fols 6–7, 20–21, 34-35, 48–49, 62–63, 76–77, 90–91 and 103–04, with strips adhered to fols 90–91 (Re-using Manuscripts in Late Medieval England: Repairing, Recycling, Sharing [Boydell & Brewer, 2022], p. 75). Ryley cites MS. Rawl. poet. 163 as another example of reinforcing strips in a manuscript of Troilus and Criseyde ; These strips are made from what Ryley terms 'recycled material' and evidence of this is that they have traces of writing on them. Although the writing on the strips is barely legible, Ryley postulates that the strips are taken from a document of some sort, most likely from the 15th century; the date assigned by Ryley would make the recycyled document roughly contemporary with the manuscript itself. Ryley hazards that the strips on fols 14-15 may contain the name ‘John’ (Re-using Manuscripts in Late Medieval England [Boydell & Brewer, 2022], p. 76)",,,True,,,,,,219 mm,219.0,219.0,149 mm,149.0,149.0,,,,mm,False
