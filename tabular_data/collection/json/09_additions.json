This last hand, writing in a thin small secretary script in gray adds some annotations in the early folios, e.g. fol. 5 (‘de saint J. B’ against Matthew 11.i), to which a thicker and darker script of the same style and date adds further a note (cf. also this hand’s ‘nota’ mark at fol. 26v and 27); it also marks up the text on occasion for liturgical use (fol. 1v: ‘fer. s. i in adventum ebdo. i’, next to Matthew 3.i; fol. 5: ‘doc’ 3 in aduen¦¦’, next to Matthew 11.i; fol. 14v: ‘fer’ iiij in adu’, next to opening of Mark; fol. 38v: ‘fer’ 2 post pasc’’ next to Luke 24.xiii; fol. 54v: ‘¦¦l doc’ i adventus’; fol. 56: ‘doc’ 3 in aduent’; cf. fol. 65: ‘dc’ 16 epl’’, next to Ephesians 3.xii). The presence in this script of an anglicana descending r suggests these notes were added after its arrival in England. There is also a small secretary script (s. xiv\/xv) in both gutter and outer margin: fol. 2-3. There is no sign of Humfrey annotating this manuscript.

Hand A appears only once, adding the name of the author at the top of fol. 2 in a large humanist-influenced script, probably of the early sixteenth century. Hand B (fol. 55v–56v, 57v) is a late fifteenth century current script with hybrid features – note the d with a triangular bowl and a sharply diagonal ascender; the 8-shaped g; l with a looped ascender; long, straight s (except at the end of the word) descending below the line – which is written in thick black ink and accompanied by an unsteady marginalising line. The most revealing is hand C, which is concentrated in – but not confined to – the last item; this reader who, to judge from the range of ink used, wrote his annotations at more than one sitting, writes in a thin, slightly shaky gothic script with some secretary elements that dates from the 1520s or 1530s. His comments notably relate the text to contemporary concerns [discussed below] (fol. 96 [manicula only], 120–21, 126, 127, 129v, 130v, 131 [manicula here perhaps by same hand but in different style], 132v–133). Hand D, an elegant tall, thin script of the fifteenth century, which also draws a small precise marginalising line, appears only once (fol. 121: Triplex bonum). Similarly, hand E, a slanted italic-influenced script of the second half of the sixteenth century in light brown ink writes only one note (fol. 126), but this reader is the most frequent of those adding a large cross in the margin. Moreover, this reader, who also writes notes at the front and back flyleaves in a range of scripts is identifiable as the late sixteenth century owner of the manuscript, Henry Holford (note the similarity of ‘-que’ abbreviation at fol. 126 and in the signed note at fol. 135v).","locus: locus":"","locus: from":"","locus: to":"","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"MS_Hatton_36_addition_2","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_6061","metadata: collection":"Hatton","metadata: ms ID":"MS_Hatton_36","metadata: shelfmark":"MS.

Throughout, there are tiny id est glosses interlineated and, less often, scholia written en bloc in the margins. These are mainly given in a tiny continental notula script, but on fol. 8r the hand is English. There are many maniculae throughout, drawn by at least six different readers: they show an interest in specific tragedies. One, for instance, presenting a very thin, long line for the finger from an otherwise naturalistic hand and sometimes elaborate cuffs, occurs in Medea and Agamemnon (107r, 109r, 111v, 112r, 114r, 116v). Another, a rather stubby hand with natural proportions, starts well but fades away (5r, 7r, v, 12r, 38r, 47v, 48v, 56v). A large, naturalistic hand with shading occurs only once (83r). One reader of Hercules Furens drew an elaborate human-headed serpent, presumably to be understood as a brace operating between the long nose and the tip of the tail (12r, 14r). The two passages so marked relate to the responsibilities of secular power and the preparation for death: ‘et impotentis terga . . . maiore vestra’ and ‘Sera nos illo . . . dedit hora, carpit’ (Her. F. 738–47 and 864–74). These happen to be emphases discernible in Robert Flemming’s notes in other books, although this style of brace is found only here. What appears to be Flemming’s hand appears on fol. 4v, writing ‘Anguel’ next to angues (Her. F. 217), with other notae on snakes and the hydra on this opening in the same distinctive light-brown ink.","locus: locus":"","locus: from":"","locus: to":"","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"Medea; Agamemnon; Hercules Furens; Her.

There are other annotations in different hands, all broadly contemporary, which mostly make small corrections to the text. These are all later than Hand B for they are accommodated in spare space. An interesting note, in a hand that might just be English, is found at the foot of 81v. It connects with a sign like a simplified paraph of pilcrow type to words in d. 27 q. 2 a. 2 (‘Et idea dicendum est cum aliis quod hoc nomen uerbum ex uirtute uocabuli potest et personaliter et essentialiter accipi’): ‘Communitas parisiensis modo tenet quod uerbum tantum personaliter dicatur et quod etiam frater Th’ modo in hoc consentit non quod distinctio hic posita sit erronea . sed quia sancti communiter non utuntur hoc nomine nisi personaliter.’ The reference to ‘communitas Parisiensis’, as Fr Boyle suggests, probably refers to the general body of theological opinion in Paris. It is interesting that the annotator should have had knowledge that Thomas had come to accept the general opinion, while being reluctant to accept that his position a decade or so earlier was erroneous. There is a manicule at the edge of fol. 15r emphasizing the words copied below it, ‘uoluntas est vniuersalis motor virium; this against d. 3 q. 3 pr. A head in profile is found at the edge of fol. 79r and seems to be a doodle rather than a pointing device; likewise, at the foot of 64r is a faint drawing in plummet of three heart-shaped vines placed in an upright arrangement each with interior foliate terminals.","locus: locus":"","locus: from":"","locus: to":"","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"Lectura romana","bibliography: ref(s)":"","bibliography: ref URI(s)":""},{"metadata: addition UID":"MS_Lyell_6_addition_1","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_7793","metadata: collection":"Lyell","metadata: ms ID":"MS_Lyell_6","metadata: shelfmark":"MS.
