                     of <span class="idno">MS 30</span>, wrote to fol. 109<sup>ra</sup>/6 ‘scriptum est’ (see our Pl. 1), scribe B to fol. 109<sup>rb</sup>/26 ‘est’, and scribe C from there. 
                     Thereafter C and B continue, merging indistinguishably. C is the most gothic and the least accomplished in that he tends to be untidy but the difference is more
                     one of neatness and compactness than of letter-forms. 
                     <span class="persName"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/person_4523">Scribe A</a></span> wrote mostly but not always above the top line, scribe B had no choice but to do

                     or blue, infilled in various colours and in a few cases colour-washed in blue or buff:
                     see our Pl. 1. On fol. 78<sup>r</sup> the buffwash partly conceals a scribal error. 
                     Smaller initials are red, blue, or green. The initials are partly if not wholly in
                     the hand of the artist of <span class="idno">MS 30</span>, q.v. for comparisons.</p>
                  
                  <p class="decoNote">Linefillers consisting of series of minim-like strokes are in red, green, red-and-green,

                  <p class="decoNote">Guide letters for the decorator are in outer and inner margins, the former often trimmed.
                     Directions to the rubricator, who occasionally uses green as well as red (but the
                     green addition to a rubric on fol. 165<sup>r</sup> is evidently a correction), are written in a cursive script low down in bottom margins
                     with a <i>signe de renvoi</i> beside them and another in a side margin opposite the point of insertion.</p>

                     skin. 
                     On the spine is a black leather lozenge-shaped label with ‘8’ on it. 
                     Some bands are exposed on both covers and can be seen to have been brought over the
                     outer surface of the back edge of the boards, not through a tunnel in them. On each
                     cover are holes for five bosses as in <span class="idno">MS 30</span>, which came from the same source. 
                     On the front cover are the remains of two straps, the upper now held by three out
                     of five nails, the lower by five nails, all of the usual type. At the top of the front
                     cover, inside and outside, are signs of a chain-staple (position 6). 
                     On the back cover are two metal catches for straps and at the bottom are eight holes
                     for a chain-staple or perhaps staples (six holes, position I, and two holes, slightly
                     higher up). 
                     Two leaves at the back of the book, fol. 199 and the pastedown, are fols. 9-11 from
                     a copy of the <span class="bibl"><span class="title tei-title"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/work_186102457">Margarita poetica</a></span> of <span class="persName aut"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/person_22136923">Albrecht von Eyb</a></span></span>, of which other leaves are in <span class="idno">MSS 2, 12, 14, 30, 79, and dd.2.9</span>: see <span class="idno">MS 12</span> for details. 
                     In the present volume the folds have sewing holes, showing that they came from a bound
                     copy. Edges are yellowed and there is a fore-edge title. There appears to be a residue
                     of staining on the front cover.</p>

                  <h4>Provenance and Acquisition</h4>
                  <p class="provenance">The pre-All Souls history of this handsome book is not known but is clearly identical
                     with that of <span class="idno">MS 30</span>, which shares with it script, style of decoration, type of catchwords, the unusual
                     way of numbering leaves (in the same hand), and the same frequent use of wavy note
                     marks in the margin. 
                     The covers of both have had bosses, suggestive of northern rather than southern England
                     and of ownership by a Cistercian house (<i>ex info</i> Michael Gullick). 
                     Both came to the College by gift of <span class="persName"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/person_3315">Richard Andrew</a></span>, the first Warden (on whom see <i>BRUO</i> and Walker, 'Andrew'), in the time of the Founder (<span class="bibl">Ker, <span class="title italic">All Souls</span>, List II, no. 43, with ‘Libri theologie cathenati’</span>). 
                     <span class="bibl">No. 26 in James, <span class="title italic">Ecloga</span></span>, and <span class="bibl">no. 1413 (12) in <span class="title italic">CMA</span></span>. 
                     On fol. i<sup>v</sup>, in a large hybrida formata script, is ‘Exposicio Radulfi flaiacensis Monachi super leuiticum ex donacione Magistri Ricardi
                     Andrew’ and, below, the 2<sup>o</sup>  folio in the hand that wrote the 2<sup>o</sup> folio in <span class="idno">MS 12</span>. 
                     On fol. 2<sup>r</sup> is <i>ex libris</i> style 1, ‘Liber Collegij animarum omnium fidelium defunctorum de Oxon' ex dono Magistri Ricardi
                     Andrew j<sup>i</sup> custodis’. 
                     The book was harshly treated in the <span class="date">1580s</span> when about 36-40 of the final leaves were removed. Sixteen of them, identifiable
                     as coming from quires 27-30, were used as pastedowns in the eight-volume Antwerp edition
                     of the Bible which <span class="persName dnr"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/person_4535">Francis Milles</a></span> gave to the College in <span class="date">1584</span>, payment for binding of which, recorded in the College accounts, was made to the
                     Oxford binder <span class="persName"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/person_4536">Dominic Pinart</a></span>. 
                     Two other leaves from quire 30 were used by <span class="persName"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/person_4536">Pinart</a></span> in the binding of a book now in <span class="orgName"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/org_150825867">Winchester College</a></span> Library, Moberly Library, 60A. 
                     <span class="bibl">For this see Ker, <span class="title italic">Pastedowns</span>, p. xi and no. 1168</span>, who suggests that <span class="persName"><a href="http://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/person_4536">Pinart</a></span> may have complained that he had no manuscript leaves suitable for use as pastedowns
                     in a book of this size. 
                     
                     <p class="p-p">In the present volume All Souls library identifications, on which see Introduction,
                        are, on the front pastedown, ‘vv.Infra.6’ and ‘ww.r.8’ (both deleted), ‘MS. i3’, ‘L.R. 6.a.6’ (pencil), and bookplate no. 8, on which is ‘163’ (pencil).</p>
