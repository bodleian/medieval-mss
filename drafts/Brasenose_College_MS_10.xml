The proper is short, the only non-biblical saints included are Nicholas, George, Seven Brothers, the translation of Thomas Becket, Lawrence and Clement. The entries consist of a date in red, abbreviated reference to a book and chapter of the Bible, an indexing letter in red, the opening words of a reading, <q>ende</q> in red, the closing words of a reading and double strokes. Commemorations are in the following order Our Lady, Trinity, the Holy Ghost, cross, angels, <q>ffor briþeren and sistren and for salus populi</q>, peace, clear weather, rain, <q>In tyme of bateils</q>, <q>for him silf</q>, <q>ffor pestilence of beestis</q>, <q>for weifering and pilgrimis</q>, weddings, dead, sick and sinners.

                     <note>Contains the usual prologues, apart from the prologue to James that is not included. James is also the only book that does not have a penwork border (see Decoration).

                        <locus>(fols. 45v–46r)</locus>. John ends on fol. 125rb and the rest of the second column on this leaf is left blank; Romans continues on fol. 125v. Running titles on both rectos and versos consisting of abbreviated titles of books in red. Chapter numbers as Roman numerals preceded by blue paraphs. Many corrections in the original or contemporary hands. Indexing letters in the margins entered at the beginnings of lections rather than consistently; the ends of lections are marked with double strokes in the margins. Red paraphs mark sections within the text, often the beginnings of lections. The beginnings and ends of lections are also highlighted with yellow wash.</note>
                     <note>Added material within the text is occasionally underlined in red. No glosses in the margins with rare exceptions (e.g., fol. 154r). Pointing hand at <q>Blessid be pore men in spiryt…</q> (Matthew 5, fol. 6v).</note>
