## Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford Libraries

This repository contains the TEI data that represents the Bodleian Library's catalogue of manuscripts written from the Middle Ages, [Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford Libraries](https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk).

It also contains several scripts and tools for processing this data into a Solr instance for use with our
Blacklight search service.

The `tabular_data` directory contains spreadsheets of data extracted from the TEI files. The processor can be found [here](https://github.com/Digital-Scholarship-Oxford/enabling-digital-research), and a user guide for the data can be found [here](https://digital-scholarship-oxford.github.io/enabling-digital-research).

For some additional information see the [Wiki](https://github.com/bodleian/medieval-mss/wiki).

For the TEI schema and guidelines, see the [msDesc repository](https://github.com/msDesc/).

For information on the collections themselves, see the [LibGuide](https://libguides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/medieval-sc).
